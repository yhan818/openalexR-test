This article provides a rationale for moving research and practice towards an adaptive systems framework, drawing on the cascading challenges that Gulf of Mexico coastal communities have endured since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. The adaptive approach recognizes that, in some situations, crises can highlight avenues for improvement, where greater resilience can be achieved by addressing the dynamic context of a disaster.

L.","Adaptation Urbanism and Resilient Communities","Adaptation Urbanism and Resilient Communities outlines and explains adaptation urbanism as a theoretical framework for understanding and evaluating resilience projects in cities and relates it to pressing contemporary policy issues related to urban climate change mitigation and adaptation. Through a series of detailed case studies, this book uncovers the promise and tensions of a new wave of resilient communities in Europe (Copenhagen, Rotterdam, and London), and the United States (New Orleans and South Florida). In addition, best practice projects in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Delft, Utrecht, and Vancouver are examined. The authors highlight how these communities are reinventing the role of streets and connecting public spaces in adapting to and mitigating climate change through green/ blue infrastructure planning, maintaining and enhancing sustainable transportation options, and struggling to ensure equitable development for all residents. The case studies demonstrate that while there are some more universal aspects to encouraging adaptation urbanism, there are also important local characteristics that need to be both acknowledged and celebrated to help local communities thrive in the era of climate change. The book also provides key policy lessons and a roadmap for future research in adaptation urbanism. Advancing resilience policy discourse through multi- disciplinary framework, this work will be of great interest to students of urban planning, geography, transportation, landscape architecture, and environmental studies, as well as resilience practitioners around the world.",,,,,,,,,,,"GS Search 1b",,,"2024-10-03 23:12:34","2024-10-03 23:12:34",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cited By (since 2021): 14","Query date: 2024-09-27 11:08:34",,,,,,,,,,api.taylorfrancis.com,,,,,,"Adaptation Urbanism and Resilient Communities",,,,BOOK,,"https://api.taylorfrancis.com/content/books/mono/download?identifierName=doi&identifierValue=10.4324/9780429026805&type=googlepdf http://science.fau.edu/departments/urban-regional-planning/news/adaptation-urbanism-and-resilient-communities/adaptation-urbanism-tov-intro-chapter.pdf",,,2021

261,"Stamatopoulos, E., Forouli, A., Stoian, D.","An adaptive framework for assessing climate resilience in buildings","As global climates continue to evolve, the urgency to enhance built environments against environmental challenges becomes more pronounced. Inspired by the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI)—a system for assessing a building’s smart readiness—this study introduces a framework to assess and evaluate climate resilience in buildings. The framework assesses a building’s ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from adverse climate-related events. It begins with a climate exposure analysis that examines certain hazards and incorporates historical weather data for a comprehensive exposure analysis. Based on this analysis, a structured and quantifiable approach is employed to assess and benchmark the resilience of different building typologies across several domains. The assessment is grounded in qualitative analysis through extensive literature research, institutional guidelines, and best practices. It also employs a dynamic weighting based on the exposure assessment of a building’s location, assigning resilience importance according to the climate risks faced. Initially applied to two buildings in Athens, Greece, and Helsinki, Finland — locations with significantly different climatic characteristics — the framework was then tested in experimental simulations. These simulations highlight the framework’s adaptability to different climatic conditions. Finally, we summarize the major findings of the research, emphasizing its importance in promoting climate-resilient building practices, supporting the inventory of building stock, and aiding decision-making against increasingly intense and frequent climate risks.",,,,,,,,,,,"GS Search 1b",,//,"2024-10-03 23:12:34","2024-10-03 23:12:34",,,,,,,,,"Building and …",,,,,,,,,"Cited By (since 2024): 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An adaptive framework for assessing climate resilience in buildings",,,,JOUR,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013232400711X,,,2024

However, only a limited number of such studies include spatially explicit data to inform planning practitioners. In this article, we argue that integrating spatially explicit urban metabolism data in urban planning can leverage resource-efficient development and management of open space networks. Based on this premise, our research presents a methodological strategy to investigate how the use of GIS data can improve the applicability of metabolic studies in urban planning and the management of open space networks in particular. A GIS-based urban metabolism assessment of Mexico City was performed at the city scale, including data on vulnerable communities, communal lands, and indigenous areas. After mapping selected GIS layers, a detailed resource-efficiency analysis was performed through the compilation of a Borough Pattern Scan, based on quantification of resource use, total areas of resource infrastructure, and public open spaces. The results of our multiscale spatially explicit analysis provide an improved understanding of borough metabolic profiles, which can leverage a more resource-efficient development of open space networks in Mexico City.",,,,,,,,,,,"GS Search 2b",,//,"2024-10-03 23:12:34","2024-10-03 23:12:34",,10.1111/jiec.13261,,,,,"1088-1980 1530-9290",4,"Journal of Industrial Ecology",,,,,,,,,"Cited By (since 2022): 18",,,,,,,1333-1349,,,,,,,,,1333,"Advancing urban metabolism studies through GIS data: Resource flows, open space networks, and vulnerable communities in Mexico City",,,,JOUR,,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jiec.13261 https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/104482/1/Otero-Pena%20et%20al%2C%202022.pdf",,26,2022

496,"Bell, K.","Achieving environmental justice","In all the seven countries featured in this book, there were numerous people inventively and determinedly striving to achieve environmental justice. Even so, there were significant differences between the levels achieved in the countries and it seemed that, at least for the countries examined in this book, the more capitalist leaning the countries were, the less they had achieved the various components of environmental justice. Where the socialist countries examined in this book rated poorly with regard to a particular environmental injustice indicator, it appeared that this was, to a large extent, a consequence of the introduction of capitalist reforms (for example, the intensification of industrial production with China’s opening up to global capitalism, resulting in reduced air and water quality); and/or a legacy, in terms of environmental destruction and social inequality, of prior neoliberal or colonial periods (for example, Bolivia’s lack of endogenous development, resulting in a continuing need for extractivism). Yet capitalism interacts in complex ways with other explanatory factors, shaping them in particular ways, as is evident with regard to Damaging Hegemonic Environmental Discourses which, while having their own momentum, are nurtured and fuelled when they are convenient for capitalism. It may be that eliminating capitalism is a necessary condition for environmental justice, but not a sufficient condition, as these other factors also need to be specifically addressed.",,,,,,,,,,,"GS Search 6",,//,"2024-10-03 23:12:35","2024-10-03 23:12:35",,,,,,,,,"Achieving Environmental Justice",,,,,,,,,"Cited By (since 2014): 91",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Achieving environmental justice",,,,JOUR,,https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/monochap/book/9781447305958/ch011.xml,,,2014

502,"Dana, D. A., Tuerkheimer, D.","After Flint: environmental justice as equal protection","The lead crisis in Flint, Michigan has captivated the nation, prompting calls for reform.1 For its part, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently reaffirmed that environmental justice is a priority.2 Even so, the discourse surrounding Flint’s aftermath has been surprisingly unimaginative. We offer a somewhat different way of understanding Flint than has been suggested to date: Flint as a paradigmatic case of unequal protection due to the state’s failure to enforce the laws. While tougher regulation of lead in water sources is clearly in order—federal testing requirements are notoriously underinclusive3—Flint is less a story of weak laws than a tragedy of underenforcement. We contend that the promise of equal protection must extend to the realm of environmental law enforcement. Part I provides a concise background on Flint and the crisis that occurred there. Part II offers a legal framework for conceiving underenforcement of the laws as a denial of equal protection. Finally, Part III situates Flint within this frame and suggests several reforms to effectuate the promise of equal protection in vulnerable communities.",,,,,,,,,,,"GS Search 6",,//,"2024-10-03 23:12:35","2024-10-03 23:12:35",,,,,,,,,"Nw.

518,"Li, V. O. K., Han, Y., Lam, J. C. K., Zhu, Y.","Air pollution and environmental injustice: Are the socially deprived exposed to more PM2. 5 pollution in Hong Kong?","Poor air quality has extremely detrimental health consequences, including cancer, stroke, asthma or heart disease. Existing research on air pollution-induced environmental injustice (EI) in Hong Kong (HK) is based on sparse air pollution data due to the limited number of pollution monitoring stations, rendering the study of the relationship between air pollution exposure and social deprivation (SD), and the subsequent study of EI at finer geographical scales difficult. A key research question remains to be explored in a methodologically rigorous manner: Are the socially deprived exposed to a higher level of PM2.5 pollution in HK? Our study develops a Granger Causality model, utilizing ubiquitous urban dynamics closely related with air pollution, including ambient pollutants concentration, traffic, meteorology and urban morphology to provide a fine-grained estimation of air pollution in HK at 100 m × 100 m spatial resolution, achieving a 82% accuracy. We focus specifically on ambient PM2.5 concentration, given its serious health consequences and the preliminary evidence of differential PM2.5 distribution across different socio-economic groups in HK. We investigate if there is any differential distribution in PM2.5 pollution across people residing in constituency areas (CAs) with different levels of SD. In our study, SD is measured by the Social Deprivation Index (SDI), which is a composite indicator comprising four socio-economic status variables, namely, low-income, low-education, non-professional occupation, and non-owner occupier, selected and combined via principal component analysis. We conclude there is a statistically significant, positive relationship between ambient PM2.5 concentration and SDI in HK, based on the SDI and mean PM2.5 exposure values derived from 412 CAs (R2 = 1.4%, p-value <0.01, based on ordinary least squares), justifying the existence of PM2.5-induced SD and EI at the CA level in HK. Our study highlights an emerging need for HK to develop more integrated, human-centric, location- and justice-based environmental policies, and the need to adopt evidence-based policy-decision-making to properly address air pollution-induced EI. Our policy implications and recommendations can be extended to the rest of the world, particularly the Asian metropolis, as well as places where GDP growth is rapid, population density and pollution concentration (including particulate pollution) appear to be high, and the income gap between the rich and the poor is widening.",,,,,,,,,,,"GS Search 6",,//,"2024-10-03 23:12:35","2024-10-03 23:12:35",,,,,,,,,"Environmental science & …",,,,,,,,,"Cited By (since 2018): 76",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Air pollution and environmental injustice: Are the socially deprived exposed to more PM2. 5 pollution in Hong Kong?",,,,JOUR,,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901117306020 https://www.academia.edu/download/86807527/j.envsci.2017.10.01420220601-1-8ttjb9.pdf",,,2018

573,"Mah, Alice, Wang, Xinhong","Accumulated Injuries of Environmental Injustice: Living and Working with Petrochemical Pollution in Nanjing, China","This article examines perceptions of living and working with toxic pollution in two periurban petrochemical areas in Nanjing, China, a heavily polluted megacity on the Yangtze River. Despite the concentrated geography of the petrochemical industry in Nanjing, protests over pollution have been small scale and highly localized, paralleling dynamics in many “cancer villages” of rural China. This contrasts with high-profile anti-PX (paraxylene) protests that have happened in Xiamen, Dalian, and other cities in China over the past decade. This article draws on twenty-five semistructured interviews and participant observation with workers and residents in both petrochemical areas. We extend the idea of the “hidden injuries of class” (Sennett and Cobb 1972) to analyze the cumulative effects of social and environmental inequalities in China, contributing to interdisciplinary debates about environmental justice and health, environmental pollution in China, and the lived experiences of toxic geographies. We argue that people living and working with petrochemical pollution in Nanjing, China, experienced accumulated injuries of environmental injustice: multilayered and intersecting effects on health and well-being, which reflect social inequalities between different populations. Accumulated injuries of environmental injustice emerged in interrelated ways: epistemic injustices about toxic exposures; unequal and inadequate compensations for environment harm; and collective frustrations over political powerlessness. The research has wider implications for analyzing the complex social effects of living and working with environmental injustice in different places around the world.

611,"Luke, H., Evensen, D.","After the dust settles: Community resilience legacies of unconventional gas development","This paper explores the socio-economic legacy created by an extractive industry as it developed, or sought to develop, in nine different communities or regions across Australia, Canada, the United States, and Wales – drawing on mixed-method research collected between 2011 and 2018. By the early 2010s, a number of unconventional fossil fuel companies were securing land access agreements for seismic and drilling exploration in the Western Downs region of South-East Queensland, the Northern Rivers region of North-Eastern New South Wales, the states of New York and Pennsylvania, the Province of New Brunswick, and southern Wales. Stark cultural, social and environmental contrasts between communities within each nation shaped community responses to potential industry development – levels of social license for developments, community responses and subsequent unconventional fossil fuel development varied widely. This article explores the impact of the industry on community resilience. A resilient community is likely to have high social capital, including strong social networks, feelings of safety and trust, sense of belonging, diversity, citizen power and participation. These social responses to the industry, combined with the existing local contexts and the differing regulatory frameworks of each community/region, can be argued to have led to divergent effects on overall community social and economic resilience across our case studies. Power, industrial impacts, relationships, resources, social action, timing of the debates, equity concerns, and strategic decision making (or lack thereof) shaped the degree of resilience with which each community/region responded. In four of our cases, resilience declined (e.g., due to increased economic homogenisation, decreasing social connectivity and citizen power); in five cases resilience increased (e.g., the legacy created by the emergence of social movements substantially increased social connectivity, sense of belonging and citizen power).",,,,,,,,,,,"GS Search 8",,//,"2024-10-03 23:12:36","2024-10-03 23:12:36",,,,,,,,,"The Extractive Industries and Society",,,,,,,,,"Cited By (since 2021): 8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"After the dust settles: Community resilience legacies of unconventional gas development",,,,JOUR,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X2030321X,,,2021
