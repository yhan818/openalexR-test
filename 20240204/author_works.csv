Although corticosteroid withdrawal in the early posttransplant period has been associated with bone mass preservation, there are no published data regarding corticosteroid withdrawal and risk of fracture. We hypothesized lower fracture incidence in patients discharged from the hospital without than with corticosteroids after transplantation. From the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), 77 430 patients were identified who received their first kidney transplant from 2000 to 2006. Fracture incidence leading to hospitalization was determined from 2000 to 2007; discharge immunosuppression was determined from United Networks for Organ Sharing forms. Time-to-event analyses were used to evaluate fracture risk. Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 1448 (808–2061) days. There were 2395 fractures during follow-up; fracture incidence rates were 0.008 and 0.0058 per patient-year for recipients discharged with and without corticosteroid, respectively. Corticosteroid withdrawal was associated with a 31% fracture risk reduction (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59–0.81). Fractures associated with hospitalization are significantly lower with regimens that withdraw corticosteroid. As this study likely underestimates overall fracture incidence, prospective studies are needed to determine differences in overall fracture risk in patients managed with and without corticosteroids after kidney transplantation.

As this study likely underestimates overall fracture incidence, prospective studies are needed to determine differences in overall fracture risk in patients managed with and without corticosteroids after kidney transplantation. Risk of fracture after kidney transplantation is high. In comparison to the general population, there is an overall 4.5-fold greater risk of fracture (1Abbott KC Oglesby RJ Hypolite IO et al.Hospitalizations for fractures after renal transplantation in the United States.Ann Epidemiol. 2001; 11: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,2Vautour LM Melton 3rd, LJ Clarke BL Achenbach SJ Oberg AL McCarthy JT Long-term fracture risk following renal transplantation: A population-based study.Osteoporos Int. 2004; 15: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In comparison to patients on hemodialysis, risk of hip fracture is 34% greater (3Ball AM Gillen DL Sherrard D et al.Risk of hip fracture among dialysis and renal transplant recipients.JAMA: J Am Med Assoc. 2002; 288: 3014-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Efforts to reduce fracture risk after kidney transplantation have been disappointing; although agents typically used to treat corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis have been demonstrated to increase bone mass after transplantation, no single study of these treatments have been demonstrated to reduce fracture risk (4Palmer SC McGregor DO Strippoli GF Interventions for preventing bone disease in kidney transplant recipients.Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2007; : CD005015PubMed Google Scholar,5Palmer SC Strippoli GF McGregor DO Interventions for preventing bone disease in kidney transplant recipients: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.AmJ Kidney Dis. 2005; 45: 638-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These data are alarming as mortality rates increase more than 60% after hip fracture (1Abbott KC Oglesby RJ Hypolite IO et al.Hospitalizations for fractures after renal transplantation in the United States.Ann Epidemiol. 2001; 11: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interventions that lower fracture incidence are urgently needed in the kidney transplant population. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Immunosuppression regimens combining calcineurin inhibitors with corticosteroids have resulted in 1-year recipient survival exceeding 95% (6OPTN/SRTR Annual report: One year adjusted annual patient survival by organ and year of transplant, 1998 to 2007. Available from: http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/ar2009/112a_dh.htm. Accessed May 31, 2011.Google Scholar) while mortality for patients with ESRD on hemodialysis is 225 per 1000 patient-years (7Collins AJ Foley RN Gilbertson DT Chen SC The state of chronic kidney disease, ESRD, and morbidity and mortality in the first year of dialysis.Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2009; 4: S5-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, administration of corticosteroids results in multiple untoward clinical consequences. The high corticosteroid doses characteristic of the early posttransplant period are associated with rapid bone loss and high fracture rates (8Mikuls TR Julian BA Bartolucci A Saag KG Bone mineral density changes within six months of renal transplantation.Transplantation. 2003; 75: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Julian BA Laskow DA Dubovsky J Dubovsky EV Curtis JJ Quarles LD Rapid loss of vertebral mineral density after renal transplantation.N Engl J Med. 1991; 325: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 10Horber FF Casez JP Steiger U Czerniak A Montandon A Jaeger PH Changes in bone mass early after kidney transplantation.J Bone Mineral Res. 1994; 9: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the long term, corticosteroid doses are lowered and bone mass may partially recover (11Moreno A Torregrosa JV Pons F Campistol JM Martínez de Osaba MJ Oppenheimer F Bone mineral density after renal transplantation: Long-term follow-up.Transplant Proc. 1999; 31: 2322-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,12Grotz WH Mundinger FA Gugel B Exner VM Kirste G Schollmeyer PJ Bone mineral density after kidney transplantation. A cross-sectional study in 190 graft recipients up to 20 years after transplantation.Transplantation. 1995; 15: 982-986Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar); however, fracture risk remains elevated (2Vautour LM Melton 3rd, LJ Clarke BL Achenbach SJ Oberg AL McCarthy JT Long-term fracture risk following renal transplantation: A population-based study.Osteoporos Int. 2004; 15: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,13Braga Jr., JW Neves RM Pinheiro MM et al.Prevalence of low trauma fractures in long-term kidney transplant patients with preserved renal function.Braz J Med Biol Res. 2006; 39: 137-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To alleviate complications associated with chronic corticosteroid administration, newer immunosuppression regimens with early corticosteroid withdrawal (ECSW) have been developed (14Luan FL Steffick DE Gadegbeku C Norman SP Wolfe R Ojo AO Graft and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients selected for de novo steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression.Am J Transplant. 2009; 9: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Luan FL Steffick DE Ojo AO Steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression in kidney transplantation: Is it time to consider it as a standard therapy?.Kidney Int. 2009; 76: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Woodle ES First MR Pirsch J Shihab F Gaber AO Van Veldhuisen P A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial comparing early (7 day) corticosteroid cessation versus long-term, low-dose corticosteroid therapy.Ann Surg. 2008; 248: 564-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Currently, more than 30% of kidney transplant recipients in the United States (US) are managed with antibody induction therapy coupled with rapidly tapered high-dose methylprednisolone and are discharged from the hospital without corticosteroids (15Luan FL Steffick DE Ojo AO Steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression in kidney transplantation: Is it time to consider it as a standard therapy?.Kidney Int. 2009; 76: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Within the first year after transplantation, resumption of corticosteroids occurs in a minority of patients (17Woodle ES Peddi VR Tomlanovich S Mulgaonkar S Kuo PC A prospective, randomized, multicenter study evaluating early corticosteroid withdrawal with thymoglobulin in living-donor kidney transplantation.Clin Transplant. 2010; 24: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,18Dube GK EZ Thompson AM Hardy MA Ratner LE Cohen DJ Early withdrawal of steroids in high risk transplant recipients.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2007; 18: 232AGoogle Scholar) and 5-year graft survival and function rates for patients remaining on ECSW are equivalent to those discharged with corticosteroids (14Luan FL Steffick DE Gadegbeku C Norman SP Wolfe R Ojo AO Graft and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients selected for de novo steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression.Am J Transplant. 2009; 9: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,16Woodle ES First MR Pirsch J Shihab F Gaber AO Van Veldhuisen P A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial comparing early (7 day) corticosteroid cessation versus long-term, low-dose corticosteroid therapy.Ann Surg. 2008; 248: 564-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Several small studies have demonstrated that in comparison to corticosteroid-based immunosuppression (CSBI), corticosteroid withdrawal was associated with preserved bone mass after transplantation (19Aroldi A Tarantino A Montagnino G Cesana B Cocucci C Ponticelli C Effects of three immunosuppressive regimens on vertebral bone density in renal transplant recipients: A prospective study.Transplantation. 1997; 63: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Farmer CK Hampson G Abbs IC et al.Late low-dose steroid withdrawal in renal transplant recipients increases bone formation and bone mineral density.Am J Transplant. 2006; 6: 2929-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21van den Ham EC Kooman JP Christiaans ML van Hooff JP The influence of early steroid withdrawal on body composition and bone mineral density in renal transplantation patients.Transpl Int. 2003; 16: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Ing SW Sinnott LT Donepudi S Davies EA Pelletier RP Lane NE Change in bone mineral density at one year following glucocorticoid withdrawal in kidney transplant recipients.Clin Transplant. 2010; 25: E113-E123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, these studies lacked statistical power to determine whether ECSW was associated with lower fracture risk than CSBI. In light of data suggesting that ECSW preserves bone early after transplant, we hypothesized that fracture rates in kidney transplant recipients discharged without corticosteroids are lower than in those who are discharged with corticosteroids. We evaluated our hypothesis using the United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) in patients undergoing first kidney transplantation between 2000 and 2006. The USRDS is the largest kidney transplantation registry and combines the United Networks for Organ Sharing (UNOS) transplantation registry data with payment data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMMS) (23Greer JW End stage renal disease and Medicare.Health Care Financ Rev. 2003; 24: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar,24System USRDUSRDS 2009 annual data report: Atlas of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in the United States.. National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, MD2009Google Scholar). We estimated incident fractures leading to hospitalization among patients with a first kidney transplant between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2006 (n = 77 430; CSBI = 66 266; ECSW = 11 164) who were discharged from the hospital either with or without corticosteroids. Patients were excluded for transplantation before 2000, a history of multiple kidney or other organ transplantations or graft failure within 180 days of transplantation. Follow-up continued until death, graft failure, fracture or December 31, 2007. Our reported rates of graft survival included death as cause of graft failure. Fractures leading to hospitalizations were chosen because they are less subject to interpretation than outpatient cases of fractures, especially because the USRDS database has no information on radiographic studies; also these fracture rates can be compared directly to the National Center for Health Statistics (1Abbott KC Oglesby RJ Hypolite IO et al.Hospitalizations for fractures after renal transplantation in the United States.Ann Epidemiol. 2001; 11: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Corticosteroid administration at time of discharge was determined from UNOS Immunosuppression Treatment Forms (25Available from: http://www.usrds.org/2008/rg/forms/10_UNOS_Transplant_Forms.pdf. Accessed May 18, 2011.Google Scholar) contained within USRDS, which are submitted at the time of transplantation. UNOS forms contain information regarding induction regimen and duration, type of immunosuppression maintenance at hospital discharge and the treatment of rejection episodes; however, medication doses are not included. First-time fractures resulting in hospitalization were determined from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for fracture (ICD-9-CM codes 805·0–829·9) contained within USRDS and obtained from claims data submitted to CMMS. Both phalangeal (ICD-9-CM 816.0–816.9; 826.0–826.9) and skull (ICD9-CM 850–854) fractures were excluded. In the event of multiple fractures in the same patient, we considered first listing of a fracture specific ICD-9-CM code as the fracture event. Both traumatic and fragility fractures were included because the level of trauma associated with fracture was not completely recorded in USRDS; similar to low-trauma fractures, high-trauma fractures are associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of future fracture (26Mackey DC Lui LY Cawthon PM et al.High-trauma fractures and low bone mineral density in older women and men.Jama. [Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural]. 2007; 298: 2381-2388Google Scholar). Fracture covariates obtained from USRDS were selected on the basis of epidemiologic studies that demonstrated their ability to predict fracture in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney transplant populations (3Ball AM Gillen DL Sherrard D et al.Risk of hip fracture among dialysis and renal transplant recipients.JAMA: J Am Med Assoc. 2002; 288: 3014-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar,27Alem AM Sherrard DJ Gillen DL et al.Increased risk of hip fracture among patients with end-stage renal disease.Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 396-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 28Stehman-Breen CO Sherrard DJ Alem AM et al.Risk factors for hip fracture among patients with end-stage renal disease.Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 2200-2205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nickolas TL McMahon DJ Shane E Relationship between moderate to severe kidney disease and hip fracture in the United States.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2006; 17: 3223-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 30Coco M Rush H Increased incidence of hip fractures in dialysis patients with low serum parathyroid hormone.Am J Kidney Dis. 2000; 36: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 31Mussolino ME Looker AC Madans JH Langlois JA Orwoll ES Risk factors for hip fracture in white men: The NHANES I epidemiologic follow-up study.J Bone Miner Res. 1998; 13: 918-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 32Ensrud KE Lipschutz RC Cauley JA et al.Body size and hip fracture risk in older women: A Prospective study.

These included age at transplantation (years), gender, race (White, Black, Asian and Other), body mass index (BMI), HLA-matching (0; 1–2; 3–4 and 5–6), donor type (deceased or living), induction at transplant, parathyroidectomy (before or after transplantation) and a history of pretransplantation dialysis, pretransplantation fracture and pre-transplantation diabetes. BMI was evaluated both as continuous and categorical parameters: underweight (BMI <18.5), normal (BMI 18.5–24.9), overweight (BMI 25–29.9) and obese (BMI of >30). BMI >50 (n = 155) was considered a measurement error and was classified along with those missing BMI measurements (n = 12 370) as a separate covariate in analyses. Pretransplantation fracture was determined by the presence of an ICD-9-CM fracture code with a date of service before transplantation. We did not separately adjust for pretransplant peritoneal- or hemodialysis; both in univariate and multivariate models, peritoneal- and hemodialysis were associated with increased fracture risk, which was not materially different from that of a combined dialysis variable alone. We also adjusted the multivariate model for other factors associated with kidney transplantation that may affect posttransplantation fracture risk due to necessary corticosteroid administration, including: (1) a history of rejection (yes, no), as these episodes are usually treated with corticosteroid and may result in long-term corticosteroid administration; and (2) etiologies of ESRD, such as nephrosis and nephritis, that may be treated with corticosteroids both before and after transplantation due to their underlying causes (i.e., USA systemic lupus erythematosis). Finally, our main multivariate model did not adjust for dialysis duration because a date of first dialysis was not listed for 3465 patients with a history of pretransplantation dialysis. However, we reported relationships between duration of pretransplantation dialysis and fracture based on a separate analysis that excluded patients without a dialysis start date. Analyses were performed using STATA (version 8.2; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) and SAS (v9.2, Cary, NC, USA). Analyses were designed to: (1) compare characteristics of patients with a first transplant discharged with or without corticosteroids; (2) evaluate time to first fracture; (3) quantify fracture risk by immunosuppression regimen at discharge while controlling for fracture covariates and (4) evaluate modulation of fracture risk according to corticosteroid use at discharge, considering both modifiable and nonmodifiable fracture risk factors. Categorical and continuous parameters were compared using chi-square and Student t-tests, respectively. Time to first fracture and patient and graft survival were modeled using the Kaplan–Meier method, with the log-rank test. Proportional hazard regression was used to quantify fracture risk with ECSW in comparison to CSBI, while adjusting for covariates of fracture determined from univariate analyses. Preliminary diagnostics revealed nonproportional hazards for fracture (i.e. fracture risk varied with time). To model this association the main hazard model was stratified by follow-up time at 3 years. To evaluate modulation of fracture risk by corticosteroid use at discharge, the hazard model was scored by logistic regression. Fracture risk for a transplant recipient with both modifiable (pretransplant dialysis) and nonmodifiable (age, gender, race and pretransplant diabetes) risk factors for fracture was then stratified by corticosteroid at discharge and presented as the population median (interquartile range [IQR]) risk. Finally, in a randomized clinical trial risk factors for fracture would have been evenly distributed between ECSW and CSBI groups. However, in this observational study, multiple fracture covariates were unequally distributed between immunosuppression groups. Therefore, in order to validate our findings, we conducted a separate analysis (data not presented) using propensity scores for corticosteroid administration at discharge (33D’Agostino Jr., RB Propensity score methods for bias reduction in the comparison of a treatment to a non-randomized control group.Stat Med. 1998; 17: 2265-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). Inclusion of propensity score as a covariate in the model of interest (outcome = fracture) did not substantially alter results. Using the USRDS, 77 430 adults who had a first kidney transplant between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2006 were identified. Immunosuppression regimen at hospital discharge was determined. Follow-up data regarding both immunosuppression and acute rejection were incomplete; UNOS reported rates of rejection were significantly lower in patients discharged without than with corticosteroid (8.6% vs. 13.1%, p-value < 0.001). Graft survival in patients managed with ECSW was equivalent to those managed with CSBI at 1 year (96.1% vs. 95.7%; p-value = 0.07), slightly greater than in those managed with CSBI at 3 years (88.8% vs. 87.5%; p-value = 0.009) and equivalent at 5 years (80.4% vs. 78.7%; p-value = 0.1). For ECSW, patient survival was equivalent at 1 year (96.9% vs. 96.7% with CSBI; p = 0.3) but was slightly greater at 3 years (92.6% vs. 91.6% with CSBI; p-value = 0.01) and 5 years (87.2% vs. 85.1% with CSBI; p-value = 0.03). There were small but significant differences between patients discharged with and without corticosteroids (Table 1). Patients discharged without corticosteroids were slightly older and had a slightly higher BMI; they were more likely to be male or white, to have diabetic nephropathy, to have received induction, to have a zero HLA mismatch or received a living donor transplant and to have had a slightly shorter time on dialysis; they were less likely to have been on pretransplant dialysis, or have undergone parathyroidectomy. Prevalence of pretransplantation fracture did not differ between groups. Consistent with previous reported rates of ECSW protocols, rates of discharge without corticosteroid increased between the years 2000 and 2006; more than 30% of recipients were discharged without corticosteroids in 2006 (14Luan FL Steffick DE Gadegbeku C Norman SP Wolfe R Ojo AO Graft and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients selected for de novo steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression.Am J Transplant. 2009; 9: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,15Luan FL Steffick DE Ojo AO Steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression in kidney transplantation: Is it time to consider it as a standard therapy?.Kidney Int. 2009; 76: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Table 1:Cohort characteristics for first-time kidney transplantation recipients, 2000–2006, stratified by corticosteroid use at hospital dischargeVariable(n = 11 164)(n = 66 266)p-ValueFracturePrekidney transplant (%)1.41.3NSPostkidney transplant (%)1.73.3<0.001Age at transplantation in years (SD)49.9 (13.4)48.9 (13.4)<0.001Female gender38%40%<0.001RaceWhite68.8%65.3%<0.001Black19.8%25.1%<0.001Asian3.7%4.7%<0.001Other7.7%4.9%<0.001BMI in kg/m2 (SD)27.5 (5.7)27.1 (5.5)<0.001BMI < 18 .52.6%2.5%NSBMI 18.5–2529.5%30.0%NSBMI 25–3029.8%28.6%.0170BMI >3027.5%23.3%<0.001Missing10.6%15.5%<0.001Mean HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR mismatches (SD)2.2 (1.7)2.3 (1.7)0.020 mismatches (%)15.9%14.9%0.0071–2 mismatches (%)41.8%41.4%NS3–4 mismatches (%)29.9%30.9%0.035–6 mismatches (%)11.4%11.1%NSDonor type (%)<0.001Living donor49%41%Deceased donor51%59%Induction99.3%83.0%<0.001Rejection (any vs. none)8.6%13.1%<0.001Pretransplant diabetes (recipient %)33%30%<0.001End-stage renal disease (%)Nephritis17.6%19.2%<0.001Nephrosis7.2%6.8%0.06Diabetes mellitus26.0%24.1%<0.001Hypertension20.6%21.8%0.003Tubulo-interstitial16.0%15.1%0.01Other12.6%13.1%NSPretransplantation dialysis (%)78.5%82.0%<0.001Parathyroidectomy (%)Pretransplant1.8%2.5%<0.001Posttransplant1.0%2.0%<0.001Year of transplant<0.00120002.4%97.6%20014.2%95.8%20025.8%94.2%200311.5%88.5%200420.0%80.0%200523.9%76.1%200632.2%67.8% Open table in a new tab Median (IQR) follow-up was 924 (600–1370) and 1501 (880–2142) days for patients discharged with and without corticosteroid, respectively. The incidence of fractures leading to hospitalizations during follow-up from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2007 was significantly lower for patients discharged without than with corticosteroids (1.7% vs. 3.3%, respectively, p-value < 0.001); the absolute risk reduction was 1.6%. After transplantation, 2395 fractures resulting in hospitalizations were identified during 306 923 patient-years of follow-up; 5.8 and 8.0 fractures per 1000 patient-years were observed for recipients discharged without and with corticosteroid, respectively. The most common fracture sites were femur (29%), ankle (15%) and spine (11%). The distribution of fracture sites did not differ between immunosuppression groups. Although Kaplan–Meier analysis of time to fracture demonstrated a small decrease in the incidence of fractures 12 months after transplantation in patients discharged without corticosteroids, the incidence was significantly lower at 24 months after transplantation, (p-value < 0·0001, Figure 1). In multivariate proportional hazard regression analysis, adjusting for other fracture risk factors, there was an associated 31% (p-value < 0.001) reduction in fracture risk for patients managed with ECSW compared to CSBI (Table 2). In addition, age, female gender, low BMI, the presence of diabetes and a history of dialysis and fracture before transplantation were all significantly associated with increased risk of posttransplant fracture. Higher BMI and both Asian and Black race were protective against sustaining a fracture. Although rates of induction, rejection and parathyroidectomy differed between groups, these covariates did not affect fracture risk in multivariate analysis. In a subset analysis excluding patients without a date of first dialysis, each year of dialysis before transplantation was associated with a 4% increased fracture risk after transplantation (HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.03–1.06); duration of pretransplantation dialysis did not affect the reduction in fracture risk associated with ECSW.Table 2:Multivariate Cox regression model of risk of fracture after kidney transplantationVariableHazard ratio (HR)95% Confidence intervalsp-ValueCorticosteroid at hospital dischargeSteroid-based(Reference)Steroid-withdrawal0.690.590.81<0.001Age at transplantation18–50(Reference)50–651.761.591.94<0.001>653.272.913.67<0.001GenderMale(Reference)Female1.421.311.55<0.001RaceWhite(Reference)Black0.630.560.70<0.001Asian0.340.260.47<0.001Other0.890.731.09NSBMI (kg/m2)BMI < 181.391.081.780.01BMI 18–25(Reference)BMI 25–300.870.780.960.008BMI > 300.830.750.930.002HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR mismatches0 mismatches(Reference)1–2 mismatches1.010.891.14NS3–4 mismatches1.030.901.17NS5–6 mismatches1.070.931.25NSDonor typeLiving donor(Reference)Deceased donor1.361.241.49<0.001Rejection (any vs. none)1.100.981.23NSPretransplant fracture1Between time of ESRD listing and transplant.2.822.333.43<0.001Pretransplant diabetes (recipient)2.051.762.39<0.001Cause of end stage renal diseaseNephritis0.850.731.000.05Nephrosis0.730.570.930.01Diabetes mellitus1.391.181.64<0.001Hypertension(Reference)Tubulo-interstitial0.890.761.05NSOther0.940.801.11NSPretransplant dialysis1.561.361.77<0.001Year of transplant2000(Reference)20011.110.971.26NS20021.100.961.26NS20031.080.931.25NS20041.090.931.28NS20051.150.971.37NS20061.100.891.35NS1 Between time of ESRD listing and transplant. Open table in a new tab To account for variable fracture rates with time, hazard models were stratified at 3 years follow-up. Fracture risk was 26% (HR 95%CI 1.06–1.50) and 70% (HR 95%CI 1.18–2.46) higher in patients managed with CSBI, in comparison to ECSW, with less than and more than 3 years of follow-up, respectively. Modifiable risk factors for fracture, including discharge with corticosteroids and pretransplantation dialysis resulted in a 45% and 56% increased risk of facture, respectively (Figure 2). However, nonmodifiable risk factors for fracture, including older age and a history either of pretransplantation fracture or diabetes had greater influence on fracture risk after transplantation than corticosteroid use. In order to estimate the influence of corticosteroids on fracture risk in the presence of other important risk factors for fracture, we created a risk model based on patients within USRDS who had modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for fracture including: pretransplantation dialysis, both older and younger age, male or female gender and the presence or absence of pretransplantation diabetes (Figure 3).

A new kidney allocation system offers kidneys at higher risk of discard, Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI)>85%, to a wider geographic area to promote broader sharing and expedite utilization. Dual kidney transplantation (DKT) based on the KDPI is a potential option to streamline allocation of kidneys which otherwise would have been discarded. To assess the clinical utility of the KDPI in kidneys at higher risk of discard, we analyzed the OPTN/UNOS Registry that included the deceased donor kidneys recovered between 2002 and 2012. The primary outcomes were allograft survival, patient survival and discard rate based on different KDPI categories (<80%, 80-90% and >90%). Kidneys with KDPI>90% were associated with increased odds of discard (OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.74-2.29) compared to ones with KDPI<80%.

However, use of IL2-RA remains controversial in LRT with tacrolimus (TAC)/mycophenolic acid (MPA) with or without steroids.The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network registry was studied for patients receiving LRT from 2000 to 2012 maintained on TAC/MPA at discharge (n=36,153) to compare effectiveness of IL2-RA to other induction options. The cohort was initially divided into two groups based on use of maintenance steroid at time of hospital discharge: steroid (n=25,996) versus no-steroid (n=10,157). Each group was further stratified into three categories according to commonly used antibody induction approach: IL2-RA, rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (r-ATG), and no-induction in the steroid group versus IL2-RA, r-ATG and alemtuzumab in the no-steroid group. The main outcomes were the risk of acute rejection at 1 year and overall allograft failure (graft failure or death) post-transplantation through the end of follow-up. Propensity score-weighted regression analysis was used to minimize selection bias due to non-random assignment of induction therapies.Multivariable logistic and Cox analysis adjusted for propensity score showed that outcomes in the steroid group were similar between no-induction (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.86 to 1.08 for acute rejection; and hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.08 for overall allograft failure) and IL2-RA categories. In the no-steroid group, odds of acute rejection with r-ATG (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.90) and alemtuzumab (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.67) were lower; however, overall allograft failure risk was higher with alemtuzumab (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.56) but not with r-ATG (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.45), compared with IL2-RA induction.Compared with no-induction therapy, IL2-RA induction was not associated with better outcomes when TAC/MPA/steroids were used in LRT recipients. r-ATG appears to be an acceptable and possibly the preferred induction alternative for IL2-RA in steroid-avoidance protocols.","2015-06-01","Clinical Journal of The American Society of Nephrology","https://openalex.org/S184267533","American Society of Nephrology","1555-9041","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.08710814",NA,NA,"publishedVersion","1041","1049","10","6",TRUE,51,2015,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2252994773","https://openalex.org/W2252994773,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.08710814,2252994773,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25979971,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/4455215","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.08710814","article","https://openalex.org/W166739738,https://openalex.org/W1553403936,https://openalex.org/W1581327084,https://openalex.org/W1665088674,https://openalex.org/W1906296259,https://openalex.org/W1933130760,https://openalex.org/W1934366345,https://openalex.org/W1938418234,https://openalex.org/W1962392014,https://openalex.org/W1990443201,https://openalex.org/W1995261519,https://openalex.org/W1996351770,https://openalex.org/W2015236177,https://openalex.org/W2022076910,https://openalex.org/W2026860062,https://openalex.org/W2035061164,https://openalex.org/W2042463878,https://openalex.org/W2043363204,https://openalex.org/W2045752685,https://openalex.org/W2053413923,https://openalex.org/W2062545746,https://openalex.org/W2063759059,https://openalex.org/W2068847188,https://openalex.org/W2078939327,https://openalex.org/W2087317980,https://openalex.org/W2093399787,https://openalex.org/W2095107584,https://openalex.org/W2121690051,https://openalex.org/W2122004550,https://openalex.org/W2122532950,https://openalex.org/W2127536951,https://openalex.org/W2142288396,https://openalex.org/W2151417740,https://openalex.org/W2315162536,https://openalex.org/W4211117577,https://openalex.org/W4251063858","https://openalex.org/W1966299088,https://openalex.org/W2029316002,https://openalex.org/W2060070176,https://openalex.org/W2065729608,https://openalex.org/W2144900441,https://openalex.org/W2329264557,https://openalex.org/W2530626445,https://openalex.org/W2586719095,https://openalex.org/W2605646834,https://openalex.org/W3028696035"

However, this remains controversial in deceased donor renal transplantation (DDRT) maintained on tacrolimus (TAC)/mycophenolic acid (MPA) with or without steroids.We studied the United Network for Organ Sharing Registry for patients receiving DDRT from 2000 to 2012 maintained on TAC/MPA at transplantation hospital discharge (n=74,627) to compare outcomes of IL2-RA and other induction agents. We initially divided the cohort into two groups on the basis of steroid use at the time of discharge: steroid (n=59,010) versus no steroid (n=15,617). Each group was stratified into induction categories: IL2-RA, rabbit antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG), alemtuzumab, and no induction. The main outcomes were incidence of acute rejection within the first year and overall graft failure (defined as graft failure and/or death) post-transplantation. Propensity score (PS), specifically inverse probability of treatment weight, analysis was used to minimize selection bias caused by nonrandom assignment of induction therapies.Median (25th, 75th percentiles) follow-up times were 3.9 (1.1, 5.9) and 3.2 (1.1, 4.9) years for steroid and no steroid groups, respectively. Acute rejection within the first year and overall graft failure within 5 years of transplantation were more common in the no induction category (13.3%; P<0.001 and 28%; P=0.01, respectively) in the steroid group and the IL2-RA category (11.1%; P=0.16 and 27.4%; P<0.001, respectively) in the no steroid group. Compared with IL2-RA, PS-weighted and covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic and Cox analyses showed that outcomes in the steroid group were similar among induction categories, except that acute rejection was significantly lower with r-ATG (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.62 to 0.74). In the no steroid group, compared with IL2-RA, odds of acute rejection with r-ATG (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.00) and alemtuzumab (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.88) were lower, and r-ATG was associated with better graft survival (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99).In DDRT, compared with IL2-RA induction, no induction was associated with similar outcomes when TAC/MPA/steroids were used. r-ATG seems to offer better graft survival over IL2-RA in steroid avoidance protocols.","2016-06-30","Clinical Journal of The American Society of Nephrology","https://openalex.org/S184267533","American Society of Nephrology","1555-9041","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.13171215",NA,NA,NA,"1650","1661","11","9",FALSE,51,2016,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2474685696","https://openalex.org/W2474685696,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.13171215,2474685696,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27364616,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/5012491","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.13171215","article","https://openalex.org/W166739738,https://openalex.org/W1553403936,https://openalex.org/W1599761795,https://openalex.org/W1665088674,https://openalex.org/W1906296259,https://openalex.org/W1938418234,https://openalex.org/W1949775700,https://openalex.org/W1995261519,https://openalex.org/W1996351770,https://openalex.org/W2000531481,https://openalex.org/W2015236177,https://openalex.org/W2022293788,https://openalex.org/W2026860062,https://openalex.org/W2042463878,https://openalex.org/W2043363204,https://openalex.org/W2045752685,https://openalex.org/W2050688889,https://openalex.org/W2053413923,https://openalex.org/W2062545746,https://openalex.org/W2063759059,https://openalex.org/W2069138930,https://openalex.org/W2074769157,https://openalex.org/W2078939327,https://openalex.org/W2081695157,https://openalex.org/W2087317980,https://openalex.org/W2095103960,https://openalex.org/W2095107584,https://openalex.org/W2121690051,https://openalex.org/W2122004550,https://openalex.org/W2122532950,https://openalex.org/W2124667190,https://openalex.org/W2127536951,https://openalex.org/W2142288396,https://openalex.org/W2151417740,https://openalex.org/W2187552589,https://openalex.org/W2252994773,https://openalex.org/W2260430538,https://openalex.org/W4211117577","https://openalex.org/W2012287078,https://openalex.org/W2039963132,https://openalex.org/W2069541102,https://openalex.org/W2104611082,https://openalex.org/W2282213736,https://openalex.org/W2283949001,https://openalex.org/W2331761174,https://openalex.org/W2586719095,https://openalex.org/W2620220327,https://openalex.org/W4240284178"

Identifying donors from whom only one kidney was discarded allows us to control for donor traits and better assess reasons for organ discard. Design, setting, participants, &amp; measurements We conducted a retrospective cohort study using United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research file data to identify deceased donors from whom two kidneys were procured and at least one was transplanted. Unilateral pairs were defined as kidney pairs from a single donor from whom one kidney was discarded (“unilateral discard”) but the other was transplanted (“unilateral transplant”). Organ quality was estimated using the Kidney Donor Risk Index and Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI). We compared all-cause graft failure rates for unilateral transplants to those for bilateral transplant Kaplan–Meier methods, and life table methodology was used to evaluate 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of transplants from bilateral and unilateral donors. Results Compared with bilateral donors ( i.e. , both kidneys transplanted) ( n =80,584), unilateral donors ( i.e. , only one kidney transplanted) ( n =7625) had higher mean terminal creatinine (1.3±2.1 mg/dl versus 1.1±0.9 mg/dl) and KDPI (67%±25% versus 42%±27%), were older, and were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis C, terminal stroke, or meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention high-risk donor criteria. Unilateral discards were primarily attributed to factors expected to be similar in both kidneys from a donor: biopsy findings (22%), no interested recipient (13%), and donor history (7%). Anatomic abnormalities (14%), organ damage (11%), and extended ischemia (6%) accounted for about 30% of discards, but were the commonest reasons among low KDPI kidneys. Among kidneys with KDPI≥60%, there was an incremental difference in allograft survival over time (for unilateral versus bilateral transplants, 1-year survival: 83% versus 87%; 3-year survival: 69% versus 73%; 5-year survival: 51% versus 58%). Conclusions A large number of discarded kidneys were procured from donors whose contralateral kidneys were transplanted with good post-transplant outcomes.","2017-12-07","Clinical Journal of The American Society of Nephrology","https://openalex.org/S184267533","American Society of Nephrology","1555-9041","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.06550617","https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/clinjasn/13/1/118.full.pdf",NA,"publishedVersion","118","127","13","1",TRUE,42,2017,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2782278885","https://openalex.org/W2782278885,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.06550617,2782278885,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29217537,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/5753314","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.06550617","article","https://openalex.org/W784677809,https://openalex.org/W1549836472,https://openalex.org/W1648231011,https://openalex.org/W2002065372,https://openalex.org/W2014925485,https://openalex.org/W2026399893,https://openalex.org/W2030009578,https://openalex.org/W2045932810,https://openalex.org/W2049746913,https://openalex.org/W2068751306,https://openalex.org/W2074769157,https://openalex.org/W2079041375,https://openalex.org/W2091942988,https://openalex.org/W2107434397,https://openalex.org/W2121596134,https://openalex.org/W2133813723,https://openalex.org/W2142815242,https://openalex.org/W2144233306,https://openalex.org/W2155515190,https://openalex.org/W2156951651,https://openalex.org/W2163373458,https://openalex.org/W2172847004,https://openalex.org/W2291572886,https://openalex.org/W2325992564,https://openalex.org/W2350785241,https://openalex.org/W2358047092,https://openalex.org/W2507568105,https://openalex.org/W2539251908,https://openalex.org/W2917257812","https://openalex.org/W1486584413,https://openalex.org/W1569816628,https://openalex.org/W2087086071,https://openalex.org/W2117376546,https://openalex.org/W2135058494,https://openalex.org/W2378019284,https://openalex.org/W2382568077,https://openalex.org/W2589824098,https://openalex.org/W3030709858,https://openalex.org/W3136218469"

The impact of this emerging technology on donor liver utilization has yet to be assessed.NMP of the donor liver and ex-vivo enhancement of its function has been envisioned for decades, however only with recent technological advances have devices been suitable for transition to clinical practice. The present study examines the effect NMP on liver utilization in the United States.The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried to identify deceased donor livers procured from 2016 to 2019 (n = 30596). Donor livers were divided by preservation method: standard cold-static preservation (COLD, n = 30,368) versus NMP (n = 228). Donor and recipient risk factors, liver disposition, and discard reasons were analyzed. The primary outcome was liver discard rate between 2 groups.A total of 4037 livers were discarded. The NMP group had a 3.5% discard rate versus 13.3% in the COLD group (P < 0.001), and this was despite NMP donors being older (47.7 vs 39.5 years, P < 0.0001), more frequently donation after cardiac death (DCD) (18% vs 7%, P < 0.001), and having a greater donor risk index (1.6 vs 1.5, P < 0.05). The most common reasons for liver discard in the COLD group were biopsy findings (38%), DCD warm ischemic time (11%), and prolonged preservation time (10%). Survival analysis, following propensity score matching, found no significant difference in 1-year overall survival between recipients of NMP versus COLD livers.NMP reduces the discard rate of procured livers despite its use in donors traditionally considered of more marginal quality. NMP maintains excellent graft and patient survival. Broader application of NMP technology holds the potential to generate a significant number of additional liver grafts for transplantation every year, thus greatly reducing the nationwide disparity between supply and demand.","2020-07-16","Annals of Surgery","https://openalex.org/S157664895","Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","0003-4932","https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004198",NA,NA,NA,"397","401","272","3",FALSE,37,2020,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3045184851","https://openalex.org/W3045184851,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004198,3045184851,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32694447","https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004198","article","https://openalex.org/W1525452866,https://openalex.org/W1975542837,https://openalex.org/W1995148402,https://openalex.org/W1996904669,https://openalex.org/W2018551009,https://openalex.org/W2055168569,https://openalex.org/W2065788180,https://openalex.org/W2094265038,https://openalex.org/W2127531748,https://openalex.org/W2244580791,https://openalex.org/W2269486335,https://openalex.org/W2344847967,https://openalex.org/W2462423202,https://openalex.org/W2520335943,https://openalex.org/W2547960323,https://openalex.org/W2605453192,https://openalex.org/W2790773963,https://openalex.org/W2793915381,https://openalex.org/W2797665619,https://openalex.org/W2803375724,https://openalex.org/W2897465171,https://openalex.org/W2898560828,https://openalex.org/W2898923803,https://openalex.org/W2919194681,https://openalex.org/W2919961658,https://openalex.org/W2930330274,https://openalex.org/W2934044178,https://openalex.org/W2942019273,https://openalex.org/W2944241489,https://openalex.org/W2972926468,https://openalex.org/W2989083296,https://openalex.org/W2998174673,https://openalex.org/W3000332038,https://openalex.org/W3001041655","https://openalex.org/W1893290019,https://openalex.org/W2135350228,https://openalex.org/W2464096277,https://openalex.org/W2729105711,https://openalex.org/W2795910049,https://openalex.org/W2902742802,https://openalex.org/W2957410599,https://openalex.org/W2972982516,https://openalex.org/W3045184851,https://openalex.org/W3162067738"

These findings demonstrate the potential to expand and to improve utilization of this resource without compromising outcomes for recipients. Improved, evidence-based evaluation and allocation of deceased diabetic donor kidneys is needed to optimize their use. The continually growing number of patients being waitlisted for renal transplantation leads to an urgent need for novel approaches to expand the donor pool (1Ramos E Aoun S Harmon WE Expanding the Donor Pool: Effect on Graft Outcome.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2590-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There has been a steady increase in the number of deceased donor organs obtained from individuals with obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus in the United States, where the prevalence of these characteristics has increased significantly in the last two decades,a trend which is likely to continue to the foreseeable future. Because there is only limited data available in the literature about the function and survival of allografts obtained from diabetic deceased donors, we felt it important to obtain a better understanding of current utilization patterns and outcomes for organs these donors, in particular nonextended criteria diabetic donors (referred to as diabetic standard criteria donors [D-SCD]; Ref. 2Akinlolu OO Alan BL Jeffrey DP et al.Impact of pre-existing donor hypertension and diabetes mellitus on cadaveric renal transplant outcomes.Am J Kid Dis. 2000; 36: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The reversal of early changes of diabetic nephropathy after transplantation of deceased diabetic donor kidneys into euglycemic individuals, first demonstrated in 1983 by Abouna, following experimental data in rodents, raised the possibility of the effective use of kidneys from D-SCDs (3Abouna GM Al-Adnani MS Kremer GD Kumar SA Daddah SK Kusma G Reversal of diabetic nephropathy in human cadaveric kidneys after transplantation into non-diabetic recipients.Lancet. 1983; 2: 1274-1276Abstract PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In these initial cases, kidneys procured from a single diabetic donor were transplanted into two nondiabetic recipients. Follow up-biopsies performed at 7 months after transplantation demonstrated reversal of mesangial diabetic changes. One patient died with a functioning allograft at 22 months and the other patient had a functioning allograft at 36 months, despite the development of new onset diabetes after transplantation (3Abouna GM Al-Adnani MS Kremer GD Kumar SA Daddah SK Kusma G Reversal of diabetic nephropathy in human cadaveric kidneys after transplantation into non-diabetic recipients.Lancet. 1983; 2: 1274-1276Abstract PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,4Abouna GM Adnani MS Kumar MS Samhan SA Fate of transplanted kidneys with diabetic nephropathy.Lancet. 1986; 1: 622-623Abstract PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following this initial report on the use of diabetic donor kidneys, several centers began to use allografts from D-SCDs with acceptable graft survival rates. These early results suggested that organs from D-SCDs who have normal renal function and potentially reversible mesangial pathologic changes could be used successfully for transplantation and would safely expand the organ donor pool (5Orlowski JP Spees EK Aberle CL Fitting KM Successful use of kidneys from diabetic cadaver kidney donors: 67- and 44-month graft survival.Transplantation. 1994; 57: 1133-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 6Becker YT Leverson GE D’Alessandro AM Sollinger HW Becker BN Diabetic kidneys can safely expand the donor pool.Transplantation. 2002; 74: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7van Goor H Slooff MJ Kremer GD Tegzess AM Results of transplantation of kidneys from diabetic donors.Proc Eur Dial Transplant Assoc Eur Ren Assoc. 1985; 21: 655-658PubMed Google Scholar). More recent analyses, however, have found significantly worse long-term outcomes of kidneys from D-SCDs in comparison to organs obtained from nondiabetic SCD, although the absolute difference was relatively small (2Akinlolu OO Alan BL Jeffrey DP et al.Impact of pre-existing donor hypertension and diabetes mellitus on cadaveric renal transplant outcomes.Am J Kid Dis. 2000; 36: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,6Becker YT Leverson GE D’Alessandro AM Sollinger HW Becker BN Diabetic kidneys can safely expand the donor pool.Transplantation. 2002; 74: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,8Ahmad M Cole EH Cardella CJ et al.Impact of deceased donor diabetes mellitus on kidney transplant outcomes: A propensity score-matched study.Transplantation. 2009; 88: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the shortened D-SCDs allograft survival has not prevented the continued use of these organs, a large number of these organs continue to be discarded as well. Existing studies have not compared outcomes using D-SCDs kidneys with the function and survival of kidneys obtained from the expanded donor pool (extended criteria donors [ECD]) and thus fail to take into consideration the overall context for evaluating the outcomes associated with these “marginal” organs. In light of this we utilized the UNOS database to analyze the graft survival of kidneys obtained from deceased diabetic donors and compared their outcomes with those of both nondiabetic SCD and with another group of marginal donors (nondiabetic extended criteria donors, ND-ECD) which have achieved greater acceptance among the transplant community, at least for certain preselected recipients, and now represent nearly 20% of deceased donor transplants. We compared outcomes for transplants of renal allografts obtained from diabetic and nondiabetic deceased donors performed during a 10-year period (from 1995 through the end of 2004) and distinguished those that met the definition for extended criteria from those that did not. We identified 1982 patients in the UNOS database who received transplants from D-SCD donors from 1995 through 2004 and compared death censored as well as overall graft survival of these D-SCD kidneys to the outcomes of 11 087 kidneys obtained from nondiabetic SCDs, and ND-ECDs transplanted over the same time period. We also included diabetic extended criteria donors (D-ECDs) in our analysis for completion. Donors whose diabetes status was listed as “unknown” were excluded from our analysis. Univariate analysis was used to assess the impact of various donor and recipient characteristics other than diabetes on the survival of allografts from D-SCDs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis of factors, which influence D-SCD allograft survival. During our 10-year study period, only 31 recipients of diabetic organs were identified as having diabetes before transplantation—partly a result of unknown diabetes status for a large number of recipients during this period. The relative percentage of recipients with “unknown diabetes status” started to decrease starting in 2002 as the rate of identification of the diabetes status of recipients before transplantation improved considerably over time. Therefore, we performed a separate analysis to compare outcomes based on the diabetes status of the recipient using data on patients transplanted between 2002 through 2009—a period when the vast majority of transplants of diabetic organs to diabetic recipients was identifiable in the UNOS registry. All data was obtained from the standard transplant and research (STAR) file by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) dated November 27, 2009. Organ discard data was also obtained from UNOS and was based on OPTN data as of January 7, 2011. We also obtained organ discard data directly from UNOS for the period from 1995 through 2008 as part of separate data requests (request 122810–9 and 20120108–3). Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 11.2 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Between 1994 and 2008, the number of kidneys recovered from deceased diabetic donors increased from 173 to 1327 annually—almost an eightfold increase (Figure 1). However, this was also accompanied by a 13-fold increase in the discard rate of kidneys from diabetic donors, from 49 to 581 kidneys annually. Due this increase in discard rate, despite the overall increase in number, there was an overall decrease in the utilization of D-SCD kidneys for transplantation during that period, from 71.6% to 56.2% (Figure 1, p < 0.001). It is important to note that between 1994 and 2008 the number of kidneys discarded from all deceased donors also increased significantly but at a slower rate, from 1020 to 2608 (an increase from 10.7 to 19.1% of kidneys recovered from all deceased donors, χ2= 253, p < 0.001). Almost a third of this increase in the overall discard rate of deceased donor kidneys was from the diabetic donor pool, which overall constituted only 4.8% of discarded kidneys in 1994 but as much as 22.3% of all discarded kidneys by 2008 (χ2= 174.3, p < 0.001). Over the same period, there was a threefold increase in ECD organs procured (from 1003 in 1994 to 3211 in 2008) with relatively small increase in the rate of discard of these organs from 33.2% to 43.6% (see Figure 1). From 1994 to 2008, the last complete year for which data were available in the STAR file, we noted a sixfold increase, from 124 to 746, in the absolute number of diabetic deceased donor kidneys transplanted annually (Figure 1). As a result, renal allografts from diabetic donors surprisingly represent now a significant percentage of the total number of deceased donor kidneys transplanted in the United States—a rise from 1.5% in 1994 to 6.4% in 2008 (χ2= 832.7, p < 0.001). During the same period, the use of ECD kidneys also increased 2.8-fold from 679 to 1887 transplants reflecting an increase from 8% to 15.9% of all deceased kidney transplants in the United States (see Figure 1). As expected kidneys obtained from diabetic donors were overall inferior to those of nondiabetic donors (log rank = 147.77, p < 0.001). The presence of diabetes in ECD donors was associated with a worse outcome compared with nondiabetic ECD organs (log rank = 6.54, p = 0.0106). Similarly, the diagnosis of diabetes in SCD donors also predicted a worse graft survival compared with nondiabetic SCD donors (log rank = 70.9, p < 0.001). (Figure 2). We also compared outcomes between kidneys obtained from D-SCDs and those obtained from nondiabetic ECDs. On univariate analysis, death censored survival of allografts obtained from D-SCDs was inferior to that of kidneys obtained from a nondiabetic SCDs; it was, however, significantly better than that of kidneys obtained from nondiabetic ECDs (log rank = 21.65, p < 0.001; Figure 2). Further analysis suggested that the risk of graft failure attributable to diabetes was significantly different between SCD and ECD organs (Breslow Day χ2= 9.38, p = 0.0022) with the odds ratio for death censored graft failure among diabetic SCD compared to nondiabetic SCD being 1.42 (95% confidence interval 1.29–1.56). The odds ratio for failure among diabetic ECD donors versus nondiabetic ECD donors was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.97–1.26) with a wide confidence interval that was likely to be a result of the relatively small sample size. We also found a significant difference in allograft survival depending on the duration of donor diabetes as recorded by UNOS (divided into 3 groups: 0–5 years, 6–10 years and >10 years; Figure 3, log rank = 6.28, p = 0.0433) with a significant trend toward worse survival of D-SCD kidneys with longer duration of diabetes (log rank test for trend = 5.60, p = 0.0179). Kaplan–Meier estimates for death censored and overall graft survival are presented in Tables S1a and b. In Table 1, we compare donor, organ and recipient characteristics for D-SCDs, ND-SCDs, D-ECDs and ND-ECDs from 1995 through 2004 using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis rank test because of unequal variances and sizes of the groups for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. In addition, D-SCDs were compared to ND-ECDs using the Mann–Whitney U test and the chi-squared test. Diabetic SCDs were older, heavier, more likely to be female and hypertensive as compared to ND-SCDs whereas organs from D-SCDs had similar terminal creatinine, experienced slightly longer cold ischemia and were slightly more likely to be placed on a perfusion pump. Recipients of the D-SCD organs tended to older with longer waitlist times, were less likely to diabetic and experienced more delayed graft function than recipients who received kidneys from ND-SCDs. Diabetic SCD donors were significantly younger, heavier and more likely to be male when compared to ND-ECD donors. The kidneys from the diabetic donors tended to have lower terminal serum creatinine, marginally shorter cold ischemia time and were less likely to be placed on a pump than nondiabetic ECD organs. Recipients of kidneys from D-SCD were significantly younger than those transplanted with ECD organs, but had a similar gender distribution, BMI’s, and times on the waitlist; they were less likely to experience delayed graft function.Table 1:Comparison of donor and recipient characteristicsNondiabetic SCDDiabetic SCDNondiabetic ECDDiabetic ECDp-ValueN79 846198211 0871076naDonor age (years)30.6 ± 14.440.7 ± 12.660.5 ± 6.51Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.001.59.4 ± 6.20.0001Donor gender (% male)62.153.545.51Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.001.56.5<0.001Donor weight (Kg)71.9 ± 22.484.2 ± 26.178.6 ± 191Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.001.88.3 ± 20.80.0001History of hypertension (%)1038.363.81Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.001.82.4<0.001Terminal creatinine (mg/dL)1.1 ± 1.31.12 ± 1.041.23 ± 1.582Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.05.1.3 ±1.80.0001Cold ischemia time (h)18.9 ± 18.420.2 ± 8.320.7 ± 8.72Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.05.20.9 ± 8.50.0001Organ placed on pump (%)74.780.786.12Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.05.84.2<0.001Recipient age (years)44.6 ± 1448.4 ± 13.453.1 ± 12.71Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.001.54.4 ± 120.0001Recipient gender (% male)6059.661.461.30.028Recipient BMI (kg/m2Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.05.)26.6. ± 5.54Excluded patients with erroneous BMI reported.27 ± 11.126.9 ± 5.526.9 ± 5.10.0001Recipient diabetes (%)34.326.129.831<0.001HLA mismatch3.5 ± 1.83.5 ± 1.83.6 ± 1.71Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.001.3.7 ± 1.70.0001Patients with PRA > 80%7.38%3Comparison of diabetic to nondiabetic donors (either ECD or SCD) were not significant.7.33%3Comparison of diabetic to nondiabetic donors (either ECD or SCD) were not significant.4.71%3Comparison of diabetic to nondiabetic donors (either ECD or SCD) were not significant.4.56%3Comparison of diabetic to nondiabetic donors (either ECD or SCD) were not significant.<0.001Patients with previous transplants13.1%3Comparison of diabetic to nondiabetic donors (either ECD or SCD) were not significant.14.9%3Comparison of diabetic to nondiabetic donors (either ECD or SCD) were not significant.9.04%7.90%<0.001Waitlist duration (years)1.68 ± 1.651.95 ± 1.761.87 ± 1.661.90 ± 1.620.0001Delayed graft function (%)20.726.735a38.4<0.001na = not applicable.1 Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.001.2 Comparison of diabetic SCD and nondiabetic ECD p < 0.05.3 Comparison of diabetic to nondiabetic donors (either ECD or SCD) were not significant.4 Excluded patients with erroneous BMI reported. Open table in a new tab na = not applicable. Using the Cox proportional hazards model for patients transplanted with D-SCD kidneys, we found that neither the gender or body mass index of the donor and recipient, nor a history of donor hypertension significantly influenced the outcomes of renal allografts, (see Table 2). Neither preservation on a perfusion pump nor the total cold ischemia time of the donor organ appeared to significantly impact allograft survival in this study. However recipient and donor age, terminal donor creatinine, duration of diabetes in the donor, time spent by the recipient on the waitlist (rather than dialysis time) and the degree of HLA mismatch were found to significantly influence outcomes (Table 2; Ref. 9Schold JD Sehgal AR Srinivas TR Poggio ED Navaneethan SD Kaplan B Marked variation of the association of ESRD duration before and after wait listing on kidney transplant outcomes.Am J Transplant. 2010; 10: 2008-2016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The factors that were found significant on univariate analysis were then included in the multivariate model, where donor age, recipient age and recipient BMI > 40 Kg/m2 remained significant. Models, adjusted for the same characteristics using death censored and overall graft survival for diabetic donors as well as all donors are included in the supplementary data section.Table 2:Cox proportional hazards model for kidney graft survival outcomes from diabetic SCD donorsUnivariateMultivariateHazard ratioStandard errorzp-Value95% Confidence intervalHazard ratioStandard errorzp-Value95% Confidence intervalDonor age (yrs)1.0110.0033.160.0021.004–1.0171.0170.63.110.0021.007–1.029Male donor1.0300.0850.400.6920.879–1.214–––––Donor creatinine1.0590.0252.470.0141.012–1.1091.050.0311.730.0840.993–1.115Donor weight (Kg)1.0000.002–0.110.9080996–1.002–––––Donor DM duration1.1350.0612.360.0181.021–1.2621.0340.0870.400.6920.876–1.220Donor hypertension1.1100.0941.230.2170.940–1.311–––––Cold ischemia time (h)1.0090.0051.850.0640.999–1.020–––––Organ pumped1.2610.3670.800.4260.713–2.230–––––Recipient age (yrs)0.9900.003–3.330.0010.984–0.9960.9690.005–5.850.0000.958–0.979Male recipient1.0270.0860.320.7490.872–1.209–––––Recipient BMI (<20 Kg/m2)1.2360.0386.910.0001.164–1.3120.6030.166–1.840.0660.352–1.034Recipient BMI (20–30 Kg/m2)Ref––––Ref––––Recipient BMI (30–40 Kg/m2)1.1470.0295.450.0001.092–1.2061.540.2422.750.0061.132–2.097Recipient BMI (>40 Kg/m2)1.2480.0952.920.0041.076–1.4491.850.7221.580.1440.863–3.974Recipient diabetes0.7850.556–0.340.7320.195–3.150–––––HLA mismatch1.0830.0253.430.0011.035–1.1351.0690.0421.680.0920.989–1.155Time on waitlist (yrs)1.0520.0242.220.0271.006–1.0101.0710.3981.850.0640.995–1.152 Open table in a new tab We have also found that in the past several years there has been a sharp increase in the use of organs from diabetic donors for diabetic recipients. The percentage of kidneys from diabetic donors transplanted into diabetic recipients rose significantly from 0–0.5% before 2002 to 38.4% in 2008 (Figure 4, χ2 > 1000, p < 0.001). Although only seven diabetic kidneys were transplanted into diabetic recipients before 2002, 259 diabetic recipients received diabetic donor kidneys in 2008. Overall, graft survival of organs from diabetic donors was significantly worse among diabetic recipients than among nondiabetic recipients. (Figure 5A; log rank = 11.83, p = 0.0006). However, death censored survival of allografts obtained from diabetic donors was similar among diabetic and nondiabetic recipients for the period of available follow-up after transplantation (Figure 5B; log rank = 0.9, p = 0.3435).Figure 5:(A) Comparison of overall renal allograft survival of organs obtained from diabetic donors directed to diabetic and nondiabetic recipients. (B) Comparison of death censored renal allograft survival of organs obtained from diabetic donors directed to diabetic and nondiabetic recipients.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We utilized the UNOS database to analyze the procurement and transplant rates of kidneys from deceased donors with diabetes mellitus, and the outcomes of transplantation with these kidneys. The overall number of deceased diabetic donor kidneys procured and transplanted has increased dramatically over the past decade. Despite the increase in the use of renal allografts from diabetic donors, there seems to be a relative paucity of data focusing on the outcomes of kidneys obtained from diabetic donors. A small single center in 2002 analysis demonstrated the absence of significant differences in graft survival between recipients of diabetic and nondiabetic donor kidneys (6Becker YT Leverson GE D’Alessandro AM Sollinger HW Becker BN Diabetic kidneys can safely expand the donor pool.Transplantation. 2002; 74: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An early analysis of the UNOS registry (2000) suggested a slightly lower 3-year graft survival (75% vs. 72%) for organs from diabetic donors compared to controls. In this study, the duration of donor diabetes was not an independent predictor of outcomes (10Ojo AO Leichtman AB Punch JD et al.Impact of pre-existing donor hypertension and diabetes mellitus on cadaveric renal transplant outcomes.Am J Kid Dis. 2000; 36: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A more recent propensity score matched comparison of diabetic donor outcomes also demonstrated statistically significant inferior outcomes for these organs but noted that the absolute difference in graft survival was small (hazard ratio of 1.11) over the 10-year study period, supporting the utilization of these organs (8Ahmad M Cole EH Cardella CJ et al.Impact of deceased donor diabetes mellitus on kidney transplant outcomes: A propensity score-matched study.Transplantation. 2009; 88: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, this analysis suggested that longer duration of diabetes in the donor was associated with worse outcomes (8Ahmad M Cole EH Cardella CJ et al.Impact of deceased donor diabetes mellitus on kidney transplant outcomes: A propensity score-matched study.Transplantation. 2009; 88: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes in the population is changing the comorbidity profile of the deceased donor pool. This change is being accompanied by an increasing procurement rate of diabetic donor kidneys. Before 2000, overall 15% of kidneys obtained from deceased donors were discarded—but over 50% of kidneys obtained from donors older than 60 were discarded (11Rosengard BR Feng S Alfrey EJ et al.Report of the Crystal City Meeting to maximize the use of organs recovered from the cadaver donor.Am J Transplant. 2002; 2: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,12Metzger RA Delmonico FL Feng S Port FK Wynn JJ Merion RM Expanded criteria donors for kidney transplantation.Am J Transplant. 2003; 3: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Appropriate characterization of kidneys from older donors and quantification in 2001 of the risk of graft failure associated with transplantation of such organs (eventually labeled as ECDs) contributed to an increased use of ECD kidneys (11Rosengard BR Feng S Alfrey EJ et al.Report of the Crystal City Meeting to maximize the use of organs recovered from the cadaver donor.Am J Transplant. 2002; 2: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,12Metzger RA Delmonico FL Feng S Port FK Wynn JJ Merion RM Expanded criteria donors for kidney transplantation.Am J Transplant. 2003; 3: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Notably donor diabetes is not included as a part of the definition for ECDs. Some centers reported doubling of their transplant volume with the use of ECD labeled organs for preselected recipients; there was a parallel increase in the number of recovered organs by organ procurement organizations from donors who were older than 60 (13Stratta RJ Rohr MS Sundberg AK et al.Increased kidney transplantation utilizing expanded criteria deceased organ donors with results comparable to standard criteria donor transplant.Ann Surgery. 2004; 239 (discussion 695–697.): 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Hirth RA Pan Q Schaubel DE Merion RM Efficient utilization of the expanded criteria donor (ECD) deceased donor kidney pool: An analysis of the effect of labeling.Am J Transplant. 2010; 10: 304-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Sung RS Guidinger MK Lake CD et al.Impact of the expanded criteria donor allocation system on the use of expanded criteria donor kidneys.Transplantation. 2005; 79: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Following implementation of the ECD policy there was an increase in the allocation of ECD organs to older recipients shortening their time on the waiting list, and this seemed consistent with the analyses of certain patients are likely to benefit the most from the use of such organs (16Schold JD Howard RJ Scicchitano MJ Meier-Kriesche HU The expanded criteria donor policy: An evaluation of program objectives and indirect ramifications.Am J Transplant. 2006; 6: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,17Ojo AO Expanded criteria donors: Process and outcomes.Semin Dial. 2005; 18: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Before discarding diabetic donor kidneys, one must consider the clear evidence that renal transplantation provides a significant survival benefit among patients with end stage renal disease as compared to hemodialysis (18Wolfe RA Ashby VB Milford EL et al.Comparison of mortality in all patients on dialysis, patients on dialysis awaiting transplantation, and recipients of a first cadaveric transplant.New Engl J Med. 1999; 341: 1725-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3990) Google Scholar, 19Oniscu GC Brown H Forsythe JL Impact of cadaveric renal transplantation on survival in patients listed for transplantation.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2005; 16: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 20Meier-Kriesche HU Ojo AO Port FK Arndorfer JA Cibrik DM Kaplan B Survival improvement among patients with end-stage renal disease: Trends over time for transplant recipients and wait-listed patients.J Am Soc Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1293-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to an obvious impetus to increase the donor pool of usable kidneys. To accomplish this, there is a need to develop a better understanding of outcomes associated with the use of organs from “marginal” donors. We need to expand the number of kidneys available for transplantation, and then ensure appropriate allocation of such organs to patients most likely to benefit and thus improve overall outcomes. Kidneys obtained from diabetic donors who may be best characterized as “marginal” may have a poorer outcome than those obtained with SCD kidneys but when D-SCD allograft survival is compared not with SCD organs but rather with survival of currently acceptable ECD kidneys, they have reasonable outcomes and provide a very useful organ donor source. Inferior outcomes of grafts obtained from deceased diabetic donors in comparison to kidneys obtained from similar nondiabetic donors are not unexpected but they provide a potential source of organs for certain predefined recipients. Ten-year graft survival rates are 69.5–6.8% lower that those obtained from nondiabetic SCD kidneys (76.3%), but better than that seen with nondiabetic ECD kidneys (68.2%). It may be appropriate to develop formal allocation system for diabetic donor kidneys perhaps not unlike that used to optimize the use of ECD kidneys. It is important to note from our study that survival and function of organs from standard criteria diabetic donors seem to be influenced by the duration of donor diabetes, age of the recipient, the degree of HLA mismatch and the recipient BMI (Table 2). Interestingly, the age of older recipients appears to have a small protective effect on allograft survival of kidneys obtained from D-SCD. The use of renal allografts obtained from D-SCDs seems to be associated with acceptable outcomes and such kidneys should be offered at least to certain select recipients. Patients who are euglycemic at the time of transplant and who are at low risk of developing new onset diabetes (e.g. BMI 20–30 Kg/m2) after transplantation are theoretically most likely to benefit from a D-SCD kidney, particularly since early diabetic changes in the donor kidney may reverse with extended periods of euglycemia (3Abouna GM Al-Adnani MS Kremer GD Kumar SA Daddah SK Kusma G Reversal of diabetic nephropathy in human cadaveric kidneys after transplantation into non-diabetic recipients.Lancet. 1983; 2: 1274-1276Abstract PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,21Fioretto P Steffes MW Sutherland DER Goetz FC Mauer M Reversal of Lesions of diabetic nephropathy after pancreas transplantation.N Engl J Med. 1998; 339: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). However, the relatively recent and rapid increase in the use of allografts from diabetic donors into diabetic recipients (since 2002 to the present) has shown that early death censored graft outcomes are similar in both diabetic and nondiabetic recipients of these D-SCD kidneys (Figure 5). This suggests that at least certain select diabetic recipients may also be suitable candidates for renal allografts from D-SCD particularly when viewed in the context of poor diabetic patient survival on hemodialysis (22Hoffmann F Haastert B Koch M Giani G Glaeske G Icks A The effect of diabetes on incidence and mortality in end-stage renal disease in Germany.Nephrol DIal Transpl. 2011; 26: 1634-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,23Villar E Polkinghorne KR Chang SH Chadban SJ McDonald SP Effect of type 2 diabetes on mortality risk associated with end-stage kidney disease.Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 2536-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Of note, overall graft outcomes with diabetic donor organs was significantly worse among diabetic recipients than among nondiabetic recipients. However, a detailed comparison of outcomes of these organs in diabetic and nondiabetic recipients and evaluation of the differences between the death censored and overall graft survival analysis is beyond the scope of our current discussion. Our study represents the first attempt to categorize outcomes of allografts obtained from deceased diabetic donors (D-SCD) and to compare their survival with that of other donor kidneys obtained from nondiabetic donors—both SCD and ECD. The superior outcomes associated with renal allografts from D-SCDs when compared to ECD kidney outcomes, suggest that kidneys from D-SCD, with their relative abundance and superior outcomes relative to nondiabetic ECD donor kidneys, offer the opportunity to effectively further expand the deceased donor pool at least for certain carefully selected recipients. There is a steady increase in the United States in the number of kidneys being recovered and discarded from deceased diabetic donors. Our analysis of the UNOS database clearly demonstrates that acceptable renal allograft survival is obtainable with the use of kidneys from D-SCD’s—even when the recipients are diabetic. Our results also suggest that kidneys obtained from standard criteria diabetic donors (D-SCD) have satisfactory outcomes that are superior to the graft survival seen with ECDs (both diabetic and nondiabetic). These findings emphasize the need to develop a better understanding and methodology for evaluation and allocation of deceased diabetic donor kidneys in order to expand and improve utilization of this relatively untapped organ donor resource while ensuring acceptable and improved renal transplantation outcomes for patients with ESRD.","2012-08-01","American Journal of Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S182625382","Wiley-Blackwell","1600-6135","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04167.x","http://www.amjtransplant.org/article/S1600613522275662/pdf","cc-by-nc-nd","publishedVersion","2098","2105","12","8",TRUE,34,2012,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1769140300","https://openalex.org/W1769140300,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04167.x,1769140300,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22758926,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/3409306","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04167.x","article","https://openalex.org/W1529951627,https://openalex.org/W1596687372,https://openalex.org/W1842004637,https://openalex.org/W1985882796,https://openalex.org/W1994644308,https://openalex.org/W1994887713,https://openalex.org/W2002065372,https://openalex.org/W2003524562,https://openalex.org/W2010566896,https://openalex.org/W2012034751,https://openalex.org/W2026399893,https://openalex.org/W2047455089,https://openalex.org/W2054775536,https://openalex.org/W2059692711,https://openalex.org/W2073565682,https://openalex.org/W2077166551,https://openalex.org/W2078883804,https://openalex.org/W2098403120,https://openalex.org/W2123559949,https://openalex.org/W2162516317,https://openalex.org/W2167288191,https://openalex.org/W2413682246","https://openalex.org/W159247329,https://openalex.org/W2025193597,https://openalex.org/W2042489430,https://openalex.org/W2083479052,https://openalex.org/W2115778339,https://openalex.org/W2351161810,https://openalex.org/W2531873760,https://openalex.org/W2626766173,https://openalex.org/W3154944956,https://openalex.org/W4252371801"

It improves the quality of life in recipients, increases patient survival, and is also substantially less costly than maintenance dialysis. Long-term transplant success requires immunosuppressant drug therapy for the life of the allograft. Under current law, Medicare coverage for most recipients (except for those recipients over 65 years of age or with nonkidney-related disabilities) lasts only 3 years, leaving many recipients unable to afford these medications. Lack of drug therapy often leads to allograft rejection, resulting in premature graft failure, return to dialysis, or death. This article reviews the current policy for Medicare immunosuppressive drug coverage and analyzes the potential impact of pending legislative proposals H.R. 2969 and S. 1454 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.","2013-07-01","Clinical Journal of The American Society of Nephrology","https://openalex.org/S184267533","American Society of Nephrology","1555-9041","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.09440912","https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/clinjasn/8/7/1258.full.pdf",NA,"publishedVersion","1258","1266","8","7",TRUE,30,2013,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2099896458","https://openalex.org/W2099896458,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.09440912,2099896458,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23559679,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/3700693","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.09440912","article","https://openalex.org/W1573450929,https://openalex.org/W1965461612,https://openalex.org/W1980573003,https://openalex.org/W1998985591,https://openalex.org/W2005967010,https://openalex.org/W2011398076,https://openalex.org/W2012728731,https://openalex.org/W2030485395,https://openalex.org/W2041198668,https://openalex.org/W2045321512,https://openalex.org/W2046132703,https://openalex.org/W2083635323,https://openalex.org/W2117952905,https://openalex.org/W2127001878,https://openalex.org/W2129662266,https://openalex.org/W2131506100,https://openalex.org/W2144342193,https://openalex.org/W2168105461,https://openalex.org/W2168109085,https://openalex.org/W4252320485","https://openalex.org/W1504621122,https://openalex.org/W1966625341,https://openalex.org/W2049695163,https://openalex.org/W2168922422,https://openalex.org/W2184189298,https://openalex.org/W2789484445,https://openalex.org/W2953720183,https://openalex.org/W3033543330,https://openalex.org/W3135864382,https://openalex.org/W4353088597"

We divided the study cohort into high-risk (age > 60 years, panel-reactive antibody > 20%, African American race, Kidney Donor Profile Index > 50%, cold ischemia time > 24 hours) and low-risk (not having any risk factors, comprising approximately 15% of the cohort). After the elimination of dominated options, we estimated expected ICER among induction categories: no-induction, alemtuzumab, rabbit antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG), and interleukin-2 receptor-antagonist.No-induction was the least effective and most costly option in both risk groups. Depletional antibodies (r-ATG and alemtuzumab) were more cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds in the low-risk group. For the high-risk group and its subcategories, the ICER was very sensitive to the graft survival; overall both depletional antibodies were more cost-effective, mainly for higher willingness to pay threshold (US $100 000 and US $150 000). Rabbit ATG appears to achieve excellent cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (80% of the recipients) in both risk groups at US $50 000 threshold (except age > 60 years). In addition, only r-ATG was associated with graft survival benefit over no-induction category (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.99) in a multivariable Cox regression analysis.Antibody-based induction appears to offer substantial advantages in both cost and outcome compared with no-induction.

Donor-specific antibodies detected by solid-phase assays (DSA-SPA) may contribute to the worse prognosis.

These included 62 patients with preformed DSA-SPA detected by Luminex at the time of transplantation. Patients received standard and consistent immunosuppression and were monitored closely for evidence of rejection. Recipients who underwent desensitization were excluded from this analysis. Endpoints included development of biopsy-proven acute rejection and analysis of graft survival and function.Patients in the DSA-SPA-positive and DSA-SPA-negative groups received similar immunosuppression, and a similar proportion of recipients had a peak panel reactive antibody greater than 20%; the two groups differed with respect to human leukocyte antigen mismatches (4.7 ± 1.1 vs. 4.1 ± 1.7, P=0.024). Recipients with preformed DSA-SPA had higher rejection rates (54.8% vs. 34.8%, P=0.01), including higher rates of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) (32.3% vs. 7.1%, P<0.001). Recipients who were DSA-SPA-positive and flow cytometry crossmatch (FCXM)-positive had a higher incidence of both AMR (OR 4.6, P=0.009) and of acute rejection (OR 3.57, P=0.02) as compared to those who were DSA-SPA-positive and FCXM-negative. Overall allograft survival was similar in the DSA-SPA-positive and DSA-SPA-negative groups (log-rank test=0.63, P=0.428). Differences in allograft function were detectable after 2 years (32.8 ± 13.1 vs. 47 ± 20.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P=0.023) and may be reflective of more AMR among DSA-SPA-positive patients.This analysis suggests that DSA-SPA increases the overall risk of acute rejection but does not appear to adversely impact allograft survival during the early follow-up period. Close monitoring of renal function and early biopsy for AMR detection appear to allow for satisfactory short-term allograft outcomes in repeat transplant recipients.","2014-03-27","Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S11564597","Wolters Kluwer","0041-1337","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.tp.0000440954.14510.6a",NA,NA,"publishedVersion","642","647","97","6",TRUE,23,2014,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1986659322","https://openalex.org/W1986659322,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.tp.0000440954.14510.6a,1986659322,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24637863","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.tp.0000440954.14510.6a","article","https://openalex.org/W1527097930,https://openalex.org/W1982630622,https://openalex.org/W1998041764,https://openalex.org/W2005942825,https://openalex.org/W2026399893,https://openalex.org/W2030088102,https://openalex.org/W2038620659,https://openalex.org/W2047292563,https://openalex.org/W2050421097,https://openalex.org/W2060508116,https://openalex.org/W2078597877,https://openalex.org/W2095039939,https://openalex.org/W2098773501,https://openalex.org/W2106831081,https://openalex.org/W2143375046,https://openalex.org/W2153266666,https://openalex.org/W2160215044,https://openalex.org/W2167151078,https://openalex.org/W2327763294","https://openalex.org/W1486584413,https://openalex.org/W2027826350,https://openalex.org/W2040879941,https://openalex.org/W2052365623,https://openalex.org/W2055890431,https://openalex.org/W2087086071,https://openalex.org/W2098895547,https://openalex.org/W2358094500,https://openalex.org/W2588126834,https://openalex.org/W2770916859"

This study was conducted to determine the time trends in need for dialysis after LT, identify variables independently associated with need for dialysis, and evaluate its association with 1- and 5-year mortality.We queried the United Network of Organ Sharing database for adult patients undergoing LT between 1994 and 2014. We excluded patients with simultaneous dual organ transplantation and where data regarding the need for dialysis were not available.Time trends in the yearly incidence of the need for dialysis showed a gradual increase (P = .012). In the post-LAS era, ethnicity, underlying diagnosis, estimated GFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and mean pulmonary pressures>35 mm Hg, ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support at LT, and >20% increase in serum creatinine between listing and match were independently associated with the need for dialysis. Patients with need for dialysis had significantly increased hazard of 1-year (n = 13 849; adjusted hazard ratio, 95% CI:7.23, 6.2-8.4, P < .001) and 5-year mortality (n = 7287; adjusted hazard ratio, 95% CI:3.96, 3.43-4.56, P < .001).There is a gradual increase in the incidence of the need for early dialysis after LT, and these patients have significantly worse early and late survival.

Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation is a treatment of choice for patients with both disorders, yet the effects of simultaneous pancreas-kidney and kidney transplantation alone on post-transplantation fracture risk are unknown. From the United States Renal Data System, we identified 11,145 adults with type 1 diabetes undergoing transplantation, of whom 4933 had a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant and 6212 had a kidney-alone transplant between 2000 and 2006. Post-transplantation fractures resulting in hospitalization were identified from discharge codes. Time to first fracture was modeled and propensity score adjustment was used to balance covariates between groups. Fractures occurred in significantly fewer (4.7%) of pancreas-kidney compared with kidney-alone transplant (5.9%) cohorts. After gender stratification and adjustment for fracture covariates, pancreas-kidney transplantation was associated with a significant 31% reduction in fracture risk in men (hazard risk 0.69). Older age, white race, prior dialysis, and pre-transplantation fracture were also associated with increased fracture risk. Prospective studies are needed to determine the gender-specific mechanisms by which pancreas-kidney transplantation reduces fracture risk in men.","2013-03-01","Kidney International","https://openalex.org/S97303050","Nature Portfolio","0085-2538","https://doi.org/10.1038/ki.2012.430","http://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085253815557669/pdf","publisher-specific-oa","publishedVersion","471","478","83","3",TRUE,22,2013,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2048857216","https://openalex.org/W2048857216,https://doi.org/10.1038/ki.2012.430,2048857216,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23283136,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/3587361","https://doi.org/10.1038/ki.2012.430","article","https://openalex.org/W1543301013,https://openalex.org/W1967077194,https://openalex.org/W1969249665,https://openalex.org/W1970782797,https://openalex.org/W1979066880,https://openalex.org/W1983133134,https://openalex.org/W1984194858,https://openalex.org/W1992836905,https://openalex.org/W1995861797,https://openalex.org/W1996203364,https://openalex.org/W1996666687,https://openalex.org/W1997198472,https://openalex.org/W2000175103,https://openalex.org/W2005359013,https://openalex.org/W2010696147,https://openalex.org/W2013400388,https://openalex.org/W2013724724,https://openalex.org/W2015186395,https://openalex.org/W2025769734,https://openalex.org/W2032917145,https://openalex.org/W2034501137,https://openalex.org/W2038821938,https://openalex.org/W2040065520,https://openalex.org/W2041038489,https://openalex.org/W2043363467,https://openalex.org/W2047557527,https://openalex.org/W2052919193,https://openalex.org/W2056093504,https://openalex.org/W2057426963,https://openalex.org/W2065263927,https://openalex.org/W2067591960,https://openalex.org/W2070363952,https://openalex.org/W2073352253,https://openalex.org/W2073363877,https://openalex.org/W2078116835,https://openalex.org/W2078536595,https://openalex.org/W2081171028,https://openalex.org/W2088964415,https://openalex.org/W2090885877,https://openalex.org/W2096397713,https://openalex.org/W2107651010,https://openalex.org/W2108529411,https://openalex.org/W2115349613,https://openalex.org/W2115370267,https://openalex.org/W2119004608,https://openalex.org/W2121690051,https://openalex.org/W2125341063,https://openalex.org/W2125637498,https://openalex.org/W2131962219,https://openalex.org/W2134212511,https://openalex.org/W2134263417,https://openalex.org/W2141260918,https://openalex.org/W2142924672,https://openalex.org/W2150333580,https://openalex.org/W2155359351,https://openalex.org/W2171463811,https://openalex.org/W2313649741,https://openalex.org/W4293281135","https://openalex.org/W1979650535,https://openalex.org/W2025158112,https://openalex.org/W2069830071,https://openalex.org/W2117376546,https://openalex.org/W2135058494,https://openalex.org/W2162126133,https://openalex.org/W2184189298,https://openalex.org/W2434894607,https://openalex.org/W2789484445,https://openalex.org/W4242454584"

We queried the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network registry for SLKT recipients maintained on TAC/MPA at discharge in the United States for 2002-2016. The cohort was divided into 3 groups on the basis of induction type: rabbit antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG; n = 831), interleukin 2 receptor antagonist (IL2RA; n = 1558), and no induction (n = 2333). Primary outcomes were posttransplant all-cause mortality and acute rejection rates in kidney and liver allografts at 12 months. Survival rates were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. A propensity score analysis was used to control potential selection bias. Multivariate inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios. Among SLKT recipients, survival estimates at 3 years were lower for recipients receiving r-ATG (P = 0.05). Compared with no induction, the multivariate analyses showed an increased mortality risk with r-ATG (HR, 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.52; P = 0.002) and no difference in acute liver or kidney rejection rates at 12 months across all induction categories. No difference in outcomes was noted with IL2RA induction over the no induction category. In conclusion, there appears to be no survival benefit nor reduction in rejection rates for SLKT recipients who receive induction therapy, and r-ATG appears to increase mortality risk compared with no induction.","2019-02-28","Liver Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S205547219","Wiley-Blackwell","1527-6465","https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.25390",NA,NA,NA,"411","424","25","3",FALSE,15,2019,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2903121335","https://openalex.org/W2903121335,https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.25390,2903121335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30506870","https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.25390","article","https://openalex.org/W1607599794,https://openalex.org/W1785399133,https://openalex.org/W1833762511,https://openalex.org/W1870795699,https://openalex.org/W1916860342,https://openalex.org/W1965042497,https://openalex.org/W1965213046,https://openalex.org/W1966914270,https://openalex.org/W1981631137,https://openalex.org/W1983343758,https://openalex.org/W1986785621,https://openalex.org/W2000531481,https://openalex.org/W2001123167,https://openalex.org/W2004393693,https://openalex.org/W2011490846,https://openalex.org/W2022293788,https://openalex.org/W2025698672,https://openalex.org/W2027714286,https://openalex.org/W2033506916,https://openalex.org/W2039124873,https://openalex.org/W2040393718,https://openalex.org/W2043185098,https://openalex.org/W2043363204,https://openalex.org/W2052228881,https://openalex.org/W2068080703,https://openalex.org/W2071219393,https://openalex.org/W2080490112,https://openalex.org/W2085907177,https://openalex.org/W2093725163,https://openalex.org/W2102250111,https://openalex.org/W2104566891,https://openalex.org/W2110537907,https://openalex.org/W2120177665,https://openalex.org/W2121690051,https://openalex.org/W2122532950,https://openalex.org/W2138807559,https://openalex.org/W2141316254,https://openalex.org/W2153739183,https://openalex.org/W2155704117,https://openalex.org/W2252994773,https://openalex.org/W2318607717,https://openalex.org/W2466301558,https://openalex.org/W2474685696,https://openalex.org/W2476659492,https://openalex.org/W2501770534,https://openalex.org/W2547001413","https://openalex.org/W1978190320,https://openalex.org/W2038585270,https://openalex.org/W2133235702,https://openalex.org/W2144086877,https://openalex.org/W2516580965,https://openalex.org/W2540424774,https://openalex.org/W3023097846,https://openalex.org/W3028842023,https://openalex.org/W4286715869,https://openalex.org/W4324350339"

Most HCV virus-infected donors are designated as Public Health Service increased donors (PHS-IR). Impact of PHS and HCV designations on discard is not well studied.We queried the UNOS data set for all deceased donor kidneys between January 2015 and December 2018. The final study cohort donors (n = 38 702) were stratified into three groups based on HCV antibody (Ab) and NAT status: (a) Ab-/NAT- (n = 35 861); (b) Ab+/NAT- (n = 973); and (c) Ab±/NAT+ (n = 1868). We analyzed utilization/discard rates of these organs, the impact of PHS-IR and HCV designations on discard using multivariable two-level hierarchical logistic regression models, forecasted number of HCV viremic donors/kidneys by 2023.During the study period, (a) the number of viremic donor kidneys increased 2 folds; (b) the multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models showed that, overall, the PHS labeling (OR 1.20, CI 95% CI 1.15-1.29) and HCV designation (OR 2.29; 95% CI 2.15-2.43) were independently associated with increased risk of discard; (c) contrary to the general perception, PHS-IR kidneys across all HCV groups, compared to PHS-IR kidneys were more likely to be discarded; (d) we forecasted that the number of kidneys from HCV viremic donor kidneys might increase from 1376 in 2019 to 2092 in 2023.Hepatitis C virus viremic kidneys might represent 10%-15% of deceased donor organ pool soon with the current rate of the opioid epidemic.

Tixagevimab–cilgavimab (Tix-Cil) is a combination of 2 monoclonal antibodies approved for the prevention of COVID-19 complications in this high-risk group. <h3>Methods</h3> We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who received Tix-Cil during the Omicron variant period (January 17 to April 23, 2022), with a follow-up period until May 24, 2022. We collected data about patient underlying comorbidities and post Tix-Cil COVID-19 infections, deaths, and hospitalizations. <h3>Results</h3> There were 463 patients with a median age of 68 years, of which 51% were male, 79% White, 13.2% Hispanic, 1.7% Black/African American, and 5.8% identified as Other. A total of 18% had undergone a solid organ transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only 6/98 (6.1%) had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at a median 48 days (interquartile range [IQR] 27.5, 69) follow-up. Forty-two patients (9.1%) were hospitalized, and 4 (0.9%) died, but none were attributed to COVID-19 or Tix-Cil. One hospitalized patient had an incidental, asymptomatic, positive SARS-CoV 2 by PCR. The median days from Tix-Cil administration to non-COVID-19-related hospitalization and death were 30 (IQR 17, 55) and 53 (IQR 18, 91), respectively. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Tix-Cil provides protection against COVID-19 complications in immunocompromised patients with suboptimal immune responses to vaccines.","2023-01-01","The American Journal of Medicine","https://openalex.org/S186920367","Elsevier BV","0002-9343","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2022.08.019",NA,NA,NA,"96","99","136","1",FALSE,15,2023,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4298007826","https://openalex.org/W4298007826,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2022.08.019,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36181789","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2022.08.019","article","https://openalex.org/W4213067910,https://openalex.org/W4220664012,https://openalex.org/W4220886953,https://openalex.org/W4221116249,https://openalex.org/W4226164088,https://openalex.org/W4226525051,https://openalex.org/W4280500643,https://openalex.org/W4281665851,https://openalex.org/W4281911014,https://openalex.org/W4283078012,https://openalex.org/W4283208961,https://openalex.org/W4283258959,https://openalex.org/W4284889304,https://openalex.org/W4286255972,https://openalex.org/W4288704106","https://openalex.org/W3024667772,https://openalex.org/W3046484251,https://openalex.org/W3110430853,https://openalex.org/W3111470595,https://openalex.org/W3162806017,https://openalex.org/W3164382380,https://openalex.org/W3179754497,https://openalex.org/W4312220742,https://openalex.org/W4316928760,https://openalex.org/W4319826681"

Methods We analyzed 96 live kidney donors, who had anatomical asymmetry (>10% renal length and/or volume difference calculated from computerized tomography angiograms) and their matching recipients. Split function differences (SFD) were quantified with technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid renography. Implantation biopsies at time 0 were semiquantitatively scored. A comprehensive model using donor renal volume adjusted to recipient weight (Vol/Wgt), SFD, and biopsy score was used to predict recipient estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 year. Primary analysis consisted of a logistic regression model of outcome (odds of developing eGFR>60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 1 year), a linear regression model of outcome (predicting recipient eGFR at one-year, using the chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration formula), and a Monte Carlo simulation based on the linear regression model (N=10,000 iterations). Results In the study cohort, the mean Vol/Wgt and eGFR at 1 year were 2.04 mL/kg and 60.4 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Volume and split ratios between 2 donor kidneys were strongly correlated (r = 0.79, P < 0.001). The biopsy scores among SFD categories (<5%, 5%–10%, >10%) were not different (P = 0.190). On multivariate models, only Vol/Wgt was significantly associated with higher odds of having eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (odds ratio, 8.94, 95% CI 2.47–32.25, P = 0.001) and had a strong discriminatory power in predicting the risk of eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 1 year [receiver operating curve (ROC curve), 0.78, 95% CI, 0.68–0.89]. Conclusions In the presence of donor renal anatomic asymmetry, Vol/Wgt appears to be a major determinant of recipient renal function at 1 year after transplantation. Renography can be replaced with CT volume calculation in estimating split renal function. Live donor renal anatomic asymmetric correlates with recipient renal function, and CT volume calculation is as accurate as split function testing to quantify differences.","2015-08-01","Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S11564597","Wolters Kluwer","0041-1337","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000000599",NA,NA,NA,"e66","e74","99","8",FALSE,13,2015,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2334840569","https://openalex.org/W2334840569,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000000599,2334840569,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25719258,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/4549234","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000000599","article","https://openalex.org/W1520683642,https://openalex.org/W1963631156,https://openalex.org/W1965939600,https://openalex.org/W1976743028,https://openalex.org/W1983212068,https://openalex.org/W1986161440,https://openalex.org/W1986678569,https://openalex.org/W1990038658,https://openalex.org/W1995791071,https://openalex.org/W1999434280,https://openalex.org/W2005108248,https://openalex.org/W2014164870,https://openalex.org/W2026913096,https://openalex.org/W2027171099,https://openalex.org/W2042249128,https://openalex.org/W2044920024,https://openalex.org/W2047256287,https://openalex.org/W2048447945,https://openalex.org/W2048682915,https://openalex.org/W2051251922,https://openalex.org/W2056116024,https://openalex.org/W2061285072,https://openalex.org/W2079077757,https://openalex.org/W2083987542,https://openalex.org/W2086614918,https://openalex.org/W2089520731,https://openalex.org/W2094675305,https://openalex.org/W2104675257,https://openalex.org/W2104939030,https://openalex.org/W2115629789,https://openalex.org/W2152875746,https://openalex.org/W2154254002,https://openalex.org/W2155965977,https://openalex.org/W2158016855,https://openalex.org/W2169639894,https://openalex.org/W2272875032,https://openalex.org/W2339554253,https://openalex.org/W2607031541,https://openalex.org/W4244137200","https://openalex.org/W1633229201,https://openalex.org/W2014177711,https://openalex.org/W2078800480,https://openalex.org/W2105019708,https://openalex.org/W2124543160,https://openalex.org/W2127399187,https://openalex.org/W2337081447,https://openalex.org/W2889082092,https://openalex.org/W3011378569,https://openalex.org/W4323255495"

Methods We queried the United Network for Organ Sharing database for adult patients (≥18 years of age) undergoing LT between 1987 and 2013. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) and the Chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. The study population was split into four groups (>90, 60-90, 45-59.9, and <45 mL/min/1.73 m2) based on the estimated GFR at the time of listing. Results Overall, there was a good correlation between the GFR estimated from the two equations (n=17884, Pearson r=.816, P<.001). There was a consistent and independent association of worse early and late outcomes with declining GFR throughout the spectrum including those above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P<.001 for overall comparisons). Although GFR<45 mL/min/1.73 m2 was associated with worse early and late survival, patients with GFR 45-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 do not appear to have survival advantage beyond 3 years post-transplant. Conclusion There is a good correlation between GFR estimated using MDRD and CKD-EPI equations among patients being considered for LT. Early and late outcomes after LT worsen in a linear fashion with progressively lower pretransplant GFR.","2017-04-04","Clinical transplantation","https://openalex.org/S4210215907","Wiley-Blackwell","0902-0063","https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.12932",NA,NA,NA,"e12932","e12932","31","5",FALSE,13,2017,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2588793269","https://openalex.org/W2588793269,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.12932,2588793269,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28196295","https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.12932","article","https://openalex.org/W1966265533,https://openalex.org/W1990268016,https://openalex.org/W1990802861,https://openalex.org/W2004366555,https://openalex.org/W2006921529,https://openalex.org/W2009068379,https://openalex.org/W2034328214,https://openalex.org/W2060270098,https://openalex.org/W2066135665,https://openalex.org/W2074715790,https://openalex.org/W2077668716,https://openalex.org/W2081530857,https://openalex.org/W2113645788,https://openalex.org/W2134672034,https://openalex.org/W2146105386,https://openalex.org/W2155965977,https://openalex.org/W2156543126,https://openalex.org/W2163885376,https://openalex.org/W2167692119,https://openalex.org/W2169634314,https://openalex.org/W2345878938","https://openalex.org/W1486584413,https://openalex.org/W2057091235,https://openalex.org/W2079077757,https://openalex.org/W2087086071,https://openalex.org/W2088078594,https://openalex.org/W2096709092,https://openalex.org/W2104274081,https://openalex.org/W2117838252,https://openalex.org/W2358094500,https://openalex.org/W3028727574"

We stratified our study cohort into 4 groups defined by kidney function and dialysis status at listing and transplantation. The predictive models estimating mortality were performed within each stratum. We also examined donor quality on posttransplant mortality in SLK recipients, as measured by L-DRI. This study used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). The SRTR data system is a national database that includes data on all donors, wait-listed candidates, and transplant recipients in the USA, submitted by the members of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The Health Resources and Services Administration and US Department of Health and Human Services provide oversight to the activities of the OPTN and SRTR contractors. This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of the OPTN/United Network for Organ Sharing Registry and included all adults who underwent liver transplantation between January 2003 and September 2013 in the USA (N = 72,323). Figure 1 illustrates the selection of study cohort. Exclusion criteria included the following: (i) liver transplant recipients who received exception points for any reason (e.g., hepatocellular cancer), as these patients tend not to get SLK except in the case of primary hyperoxaluria; (ii) status 1 recipients (acute liver failure cases); (iii) pediatric patients (younger than 18); (iv) multi-organ transplantations (other than SLK); (v) diagnosis of ESRD before transplantation; and (iv) acute dialysis that needs more than 3 months. We stratified the recipients by their transplant type (SLK being the primary exposure) into 4 different groups based on Scr and dialysis status at listing and at the time of transplant: LK1, not on dialysis either at listing or transplant, and Scr < 2 mg/dl at transplant; LK2, not on dialysis either at listing or transplant, and Scr ≥ 2 mg/dl at transplant; LK3, not on dialysis at listing but on dialysis at transplant; LK4, on dialysis both at listing and at transplant. The cutoff value for Scr was chosen from the recommendations of recent transplant consensus conferences. Scr < 2 mg/dl (approximately estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study 4-variable equation) versus Scr ≥ 2 mg/dl (approximate eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and the Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure scoring defines renal failure as a Scr of ≥ 2.3Davis C.L.

For a meaningful comparison, it is essential to consider imbalances between the SLK and LTA regarding the covariate pattern. We adjusted for imbalances among covariates by developing PS matching within each stratum (LK1–LK4). A total of 4061 patients were included in the final analysis. Because of a sample size imbalance between the LTA and SLK recipients within each LK group, we adopted different matching ratios in the PS analysis (4:1 in the LK1 group, 3:1 in the LK2 group, and 2:1 in the LK3 and LK4 groups). Patients were followed up from the date of liver transplant to posttransplant death, loss to follow-up, or end of study period (30 September 2013). The primary outcome of interest was posttransplant mortality. We also investigated the effect of deceased donor quality on posttransplant mortality in SLK patients, as measured by L-DRI categories (L-DRI < 1, 1–1.5, 1.5–2, and >2). The L-DRI score was derived from 6 donor characteristics (age, cause of death, race, donation after cardiac death, graft [whole vs. partial split], donor height [cm]) and 2 transplant factors (location of donor service area [local, regional, and national] and cold ischemia time [hour]). Most L-DRI scores range from 0 to 3.5, and lower scores represent better quality liver (especially L-DRI < 1.2). Donor and recipient characteristics were described using mean and SD or frequencies. Comparisons between groups were made using the t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, or χ2 test. Patient survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. The log-rank test was used for comparison of the unadjusted patient survival curves. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios associated with patient mortality risk. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata/MP13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). The magnitude of missing data in the PS-matched cohort was minuscule (1%–2% among covariates, specifically in ascites and encephalopathy variables) and all models were directly comparable. That is why we practically considered this study as complete case analysis. PS is a balancing score representing the probability of receiving an SLK versus LTA given the patient’s covariate pattern.18D'Agostino Jr., R.B. Propensity score methods for bias reduction in the comparison of a treatment to a non-randomized control group.Stat Med. 1998; 17: 2265-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (4386) Google Scholar After PS is estimated, the next step involves matching exposure versus control (SLK vs. LTA) patients based on predicted PSs. Within each stratum (LK1–LK4), we used nearest-neighbor Mahalanobis metric matching with a bias correction term (http://www.stata.com/manuals13/teteffectsnnmatch.pdf) to match and allocate patients to the respective groups. The 11 covariates used in the PS analysis included the recipient’s age, gender, race, body mass index, diabetes, underlying liver disease etiology, Scr (mg/dl) at transplant (if a patient is on dialysis, Scr is omitted from the PS analysis), serum bilirubin (mg/dl) at transplant, international normalized ratio at transplant, time to transplant (wait-list duration in months), and the L-DRI score. Statistical inference was based on the analysis within strata defined by kidney function and/or dialysis status using multivariable PS-matched Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for other covariates including ABO type, encephalopathy, ascites, estimated slope of creatinine from wait-listing to transplantation (for the LK1 and LK2 groups only), hospitalized in ICU before transplant (on mechanical ventilation), and transplant year. Selected demographics and clinical characteristics for LTA and SLK before PS matching are shown in Table 1. Compared with LTA patients, SLK recipients had lower GFR at transplant (62.9 ± 32.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 vs. 26.9 ± 17.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2), more likely required dialysis (8.6% vs. 50%), and tend to have a higher MELD score at transplant (24.2 ± 9.2 vs. 30.9 ± 8.4). After PS matching, the LK groups were well balanced on the distribution of covariates (Supplementary Tables S1a–S1d). The median waiting time to transplantation was approximately 2 months in all groups except the LK4 group (<1 month). The recipients in the LK3 and LK4 groups had more severe disease on the level of liver and kidney dysfunction.Table 1Characteristics of liver transplant candidates before propensity score matching by transplant type (UNOS data between 2003 and 2013 in the USA)NLTASLKP valueN = 35,94734,3371610Age (yr)aThe variables used in the propensity score matching.35,94752.6 ± 1054.3 ± 9.6<0.001Gender (female, %)aThe variables used in the propensity score matching.35,94733.934.10.84Race (AA, %)aThe variables used in the propensity score matching.35,9478.915.3<0.001Recipient DM (%)aThe variables used in the propensity score matching.35,94723.537<0.001Liver disease (%)aThe variables used in the propensity score matching.35,947<0.001 HCV infection27.828.6 ETOH and NASH23.623.4 Cholestatic10.97 Others37.640.1BMIaThe variables used in the propensity score matching.35,91928.3 ± 5.827.4 ± 5.8<0.001Scr (mg/dl) at transplant (if not on dialysis)aThe variables used in the propensity score matching.34,4031.5 ± 13 ± 1.2<0.001eGFR at transplant (ml/min per 1.73 m2)bThe MDRD 4-variable equation to eGFR, calculated for the recipient who was not on dialysis.34,40362.9 ± 32.526.9 ± 17.2<0.001INR at transplantaThe variables used in the propensity score matching.35,9472 ± 1.21.9 ± 0.9<0.001Total bilirubin (mg/dl) at transplantaThe variables used in the propensity score matching.34,25810.7 ± 1212.4 ± 14.5<0.001On dialysis at transplant (%)35,9478.650<0.001MELD at transplant35,94424.2 ± 9.230.9 ± 8.4<0.001Liver DRIaThe variables used in the propensity score matching.30,9821.4 ± 0.41.2 ± 0.3<0.001Median time to transplant (25th and 75th percentiles), moaThe variables used in the propensity score matching.35,9461.9 (0.4, 6.8)1.3 (0.4, 5.2)0.001± Denotes 1 SD.AA, African American; BMI, body mass index; DM, diabetes; DRI, donor risk index; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; ETOH and NASH, alcohol and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; HCV, hepatitis C virus; INR, international normalized ratio; LTA, liver transplant alone; MDRD, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study; MELD, model for end-stage liver disease; N, sample size; Scr, serum creatinine; SLK, simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation; UNOS, United Network for Organ Sharing.a The variables used in the propensity score matching.b The MDRD 4-variable equation to eGFR, calculated for the recipient who was not on dialysis.

For the study cohort (after the PS matching), unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves for patient survival for LTA versus SLK recipients are illustrated in Figure 2a–d. The SLK recipients in the LK2 group had better patient survival compared with the LTA patients (77% vs. 70% at 5 years, P = 0.01). Causes of death (reported for liver recipients) and its observed frequencies by the LK groups and posttransplant outcomes through the end of follow-up time are shown in Table 2. Mortality incidence rate per patient-year was lower in SLK recipients across all LK groups, and the mortality incidence rate ratio (SLK/LTA: 0.75, 0.60–0.92, P value = 0.005) reached statistical significance in only the LK2 group.Table 2Causes (reported for liver transplant recipients) and observed frequencies of death and posttransplant outcomes after the propensity score matchingLiver transplant recipients not on dialysis either at listing or transplant, and Scr < 2 mg/dl at transplant (LK1)Liver transplant recipients not on dialysis either at listing or transplant, and Scr ≥ 2 mg/dl at transplant (LK2)Liver transplant recipients not on dialysis at listing but on dialysis at transplant (LK3)Liver transplant recipient on dialysis both at listing and transplant (LK4)LTASLKPLTASLKPLTASLKPLTASLKPN5361441237570579383348264Posttransplant mortalityIncidence rate per patient-year (%)5.74.77.65.79.27.4108.4Incidence rate ratio (95% CI)0.81 (0.50–1.28)0.380.75 (0.60–0.92)0.0050.81 (0.61–1.05)0.100.84 (0.61–1.16)0.28Time to death (mo)31 ± 3219 ± 200.0827 ± 3030 ± 320.3319 ± 2724 ± 310.1916 ± 1116 ± 100.99Causes of death reported for liver transplantation (%)0.09∗P value for trend (type III P value).0.09∗P value for trend (type III P value).0.10∗P value for trend (type III P value).0.06∗P value for trend (type III P value).

Compared with SLK recipients, posttransplant ESRD was more prevalent in the LTA transplants, except LK1 group (Table 2). In SLK recipients, ESRD incidence rate per 1000 patient-days and the incidence rate ratio (SLK/LTA) were lower and reached statistical significance in the LK2 and LK4 groups. Kidney transplantation after LTA or SLK was uncommon across all LK groups (<3.2% of recipients). Figure 3 shows the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves for patient survival according to L-DRI categories in SLK recipients. Higher L-DRI scores were associated with higher mortality. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for other covariates, posttransplant mortality significantly increased with more top L-DRI categories (1.5–2 and >2 categories). For comparison, L-DRI categories of 1.5 to 2 and L-DRI > 2 approximately exemplify higher quintiles of kidney donor profile index, 60% to 80%, and 80% to 100%, respectively (Table 4).Table 4Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model for posttransplant mortality in simultaneous liver-kidney transplant recipients by liver-donor risk index (L-DRI) categories, after the propensity score matchingN = 1341Hazard ratioaAdjusted for the recipient factors (age, body mass index, race, gender, diabetes), waiting time, the cause of liver disease, blood type, model for end-stage liver disease at transplant encephalopathy at transplant, ascites on at transplant, mechanical ventilation/ICU stay and transplant year, and transplant type.95% confidence intervalP valueL-DRI (reference L-DRI < 1) 1–1.51.070.81–1.420.64 1.5–22.001.44–2.79<0.001 >23.752.03–6.93<0.001a Adjusted for the recipient factors (age, body mass index, race, gender, diabetes), waiting time, the cause of liver disease, blood type, model for end-stage liver disease at transplant encephalopathy at transplant, ascites on at transplant, mechanical ventilation/ICU stay and transplant year, and transplant type.

Moreover, in the context of solid organ transplantation, physicians and surgeons conduct many activities that are neither billable nor accounted for in the wRVU models. New compensation models for transplant professionals must (1) justify payments for nonbillable work related to transplant activity/procedures; (2) capture the entire academic, clinical, and relationship-building work effort as part of RVU determination; and (3) move toward a value-based compensation scheme that aligns the incentives for physicians, surgeons, transplant center, payers, and patients.

Scri values were obtained from OPTN/UNOS and linked to the STAR file, which contains Scrt. To denote KDRI calculated with Scri and Scrt, we use KDRIi and KDRIt, respectively. From 2000 to 2015 we identified 236,385 DDKs, of which 212,926 were procured for transplantation (Item S1). After excluding kidneys from donors with missing Scri and Scrt values (n = 83,908), kidneys with either Scr > 40 mg/dL (n = 31), and kidneys with both Scr values ≥ 8 mg/dL (n = 4), we identified 128,983 organs. After further excluding organs that were discarded (n = 24,325) or missing relevant transplant-specific data (n = 148), we identified a final cohort of 104,510 transplants. For this analysis, Scri is the first available Scr reported to UNOS from the donor’s index hospitalization prior to organ donation, Scrt is the last recorded Scr, and ΔScr is the difference between Scrt and Scri. AKI was defined using ΔScr and AKIN classification criteria.7Mehta R.L. Kellum J.A. Shah S.V. et al.Acute Kidney Injury Network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury.Crit Care. 2007; 11: R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (5246) Google Scholar The primary outcome was death-censored and all-cause transplant failure. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed to examine the performance of KDRIi and KDRIt in predicting 1- and 3-year failure. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. This study was approved under exempt status by the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University. Of 104,510 transplanted kidneys with Scri and Scrt values available (Item S1), 21,069 were from donors with AKI. Donors were predominantly male (61%) with a median age of 38 (IQR, 28) years, and mean ΔScr was 0.05 ± 0.83 mg/dL (Item S1), corresponding to a median difference of 0.001 between KDRIi and KDRIt. The interval between the initial and terminal Scr in more than two-thirds of cases was less than 72 hours (see Item S1 for detailed breakdown). Figure 1 and Item S1 compare the classification overlap between KDPIi and KDPIt. About half (55.4%) the kidneys changed KDPI category when KDPIi replaced KDPIt, with 20.3% given a better KDPI category when using with Scri and 35.1% given an inferior KDPI category. In ROC curves (Item S1) comparing the predictive power of KDRIi and KDRIt on death-censored and all-cause transplant failure, KDRIt AUC was statistically higher for death-censored transplant failure at 1 (0.6280 vs 0.6231, P < 0.001) and 3 years (0.5922 vs 0.5949, P < 0.001), but differences were small and not clinically meaningful. The same pattern was observed for all-cause transplant failure (1 y: 0.6090 vs 0.6058, P < 0.001; 3 y: 0.5985 vs 0.5957, P < 0.001). In sensitivity analysis restricted to donor organs for which the first entered Scr was within 24 hours of hospital admission (n = 84,976 recipients; Item S1), KDRIi remained less predictive than KDRIt for both all-cause (1 y: 0.6037 vs 0.6083; 3 y: 0.5924 vs 0.5965) and death-censored (1 y: 0.6213 vs 0.6281; 3 y: 0.5928 vs 0.5980) transplant failure. Results were similar when the analysis was limited to only kidneys from donors with AKI or donors with stages 2 to 3 AKI. Our results demonstrate that there was no clinically meaningful difference in the prediction of early and medium-term transplant survival using Scri rather than Scrt to calculate KDRI, even in the presence of AKI. This contradicts concerns about KDRI/KDPI being inappropriately pessimistic for organs from donors with AKI. For allocation, the most recent Scr is used to calculate KDPI; this could be the initial/admission Scr, an interim value, or the Scrt, depending on when the OPO runs the match. For any individual case, the KDPI can change substantially (Fig 1), yet on average, we found that there is no clear advantage of using one value versus another in terms of association with transplant failure. Our study has the limitations associated with any retrospective analysis of registry data. In addition, because we lacked data for Scr trend at the time of death or prior to the hospitalization that led to donation, we were unable to distinguish donors with ongoing AKI from those in the recovery phase of AKI at the time of donation. Our results suggest that there is no benefit to routinely substituting Scri for the more readily available Scrt when assessing organ quality with the KDRI.

Early data suggest that at least some severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test–positive (NAT+) organs could be transplanted safely although there is substantial controversy about this topic.1-5 In theory, respiratory viruses are less likely to carry risk of viremia and infection of abdominal organs, although no commercial test is currently available to assess SARS-CoV-2 viremia. In this retrospective analysis of the US Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database, we report the initial experience with SARS-CoV-2 NAT+ (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] NAT+) deceased donor organs, with a focus on kidney transplants, from August 8, 2020, to September 29, 2021. During this time period, 17 143 COVID-19 NAT-negative (NAT−) deceased donors and 150 COVID-19 NAT+ deceased donors were assessed for organ donation (Figure 1). When compared with COVID-19 NAT− donors, there was a higher (P < 0.001 for all) nonrecovery rate for COVID-19 NAT+ hearts (35% versus 87%), lungs (71% versus 99%), livers (24% versus 53%), and pancreas (89% versus 98%), although this was not the case for kidneys (4.5% versus 1.6%).FIGURE 1.: Relative proportional disposition of recovered organs between August 8, 2020, and September 29, 2021.

There was an increasing trend toward organ recovery across 3 pandemic periods (July 22, 2020–December 2020 [13; 9%]; January 2021–June 2021 [56; 37%]; and July 2021–September 2021 [81; 54%]). Most donors had a last reported COVID-19 NAT+ ≤7 d before procurement (94; 62.7%; Table S1, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C375). Table S2 (SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C375) describes the utilization of all COVID-19 NAT+ organs. Although only a minority of pancreata, hearts, lungs, and livers were procured, they were almost all transplanted postprocurement. In contrast, there was a high discard rate for kidneys postprocurement (102/295; 34.6%) compared with COVID-19 NAT− kidneys (6767/32717; 20.6%). Presumably superior quality COVID-19 NAT+ kidneys were discarded (mean kidney donor profile index, 67% versus 76%; P = 0.04) with the most common reason (~70%) for discards being “exhaustion of the waitlist” (Table 1). The organ discard rate did not differ substantially based upon the time (≤7 d [27.6%] versus 8–28 d [26.7%] or ≥28 d [30.8%]) of positive COVID-19 NAT before donation.

Limited outcome data (Table S3, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C375) were available on 262 transplant recipients with median posttransplant follow-up of 75 d (range, 23–243 d). Three (of 180; 1.6%) kidney allograft losses were reported, of which, 2 were because of allograft thrombosis on the day of transplant. Five deaths (2 kidneys [1%]; 3 livers [5.6%]) were reported, of which, 1 was because of respiratory failure and 1 because of sepsis. Table S4 (SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C375) shows the characteristics of 180 “kidney-only” transplant recipients. Most patients received induction rabbit antithymocyte globulin (62.8%) followed by triple maintenance immunosuppression (tacrolimus/mycophenolate/steroids; ~67%–80%). Of the 149 patients of whom data were available, the average length of stay was relatively short (median = 4 d) with a delayed graft function rate of 24%. These data provide early reassuring evidence on the utilization of non–lung SARS-CoV-2 NAT+ solid organ transplants. Many of these donors were selected despite positive NAT ≤7 d before procurement and abnormal lung imaging. Despite this, a substantially lower procurement rate for non–kidney transplantable organs and a high discard rate for kidneys (driven primarily by absence of recipient availability) were noted. For “kidney-only” transplant patients, immunosuppression regimens were largely unaltered compared with the “standard-of-care.” These data are limited by the absence of detailed donor characteristics, for example, computer tomographic imaging of lungs, vaccination status of donors and recipients, use of pretransplant (donor) or posttransplant (recipient) COVID-19 therapies, and longer-term follow-up of recipients with the availability of transmission data. Finally, it is unclear as to how many COVID-19–positive potential donors were never approached for organ donation.","2022-03-01","Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S11564597","Wolters Kluwer","0041-1337","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004091",NA,NA,"publishedVersion","e266","e268","106","5",TRUE,9,2022,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4220847717","https://openalex.org/W4220847717,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004091,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35250008","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004091","article","https://openalex.org/W3023115713,https://openalex.org/W3024441519,https://openalex.org/W3129644509,https://openalex.org/W3177707128,https://openalex.org/W3181169176","https://openalex.org/W3013048436,https://openalex.org/W3023213585,https://openalex.org/W3083031127,https://openalex.org/W3084498529,https://openalex.org/W3087427886,https://openalex.org/W3087747856,https://openalex.org/W3119779361,https://openalex.org/W3152387439,https://openalex.org/W3156800464,https://openalex.org/W3178186717"

The impact of dosing from variations in dose rounding or single dose limits has not been studied. Methods This retrospective study of 242 adult renal transplant recipients receiving rATG induction and steroid-sparing maintenance therapy evaluates the effect of small changes in rATG induction dosing. The local protocol calls for four doses of rATG 1.5 mg/kg, approximated to the nearest 25 mg and limited to a max of 150 mg. Patients were stratified by total rATG dose received 5 to 6 mg/kg (n=151) and 6 mg/kg (n=91) or more. Incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, patient and graft survival, and allograft function were examined. Results Baseline and transplantation characteristics were similar between groups except for differences in mean weight (SD) (81 [17.3] vs. 76.3 [15.6]) and cumulative rATG dose received (451.8 [96.2] vs. 481.1 [93]) for patients in the 5- to 6-mg/kg group and 6-mg/kg or more group, respectively. Patients who received more rATG showed a significantly lower incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection at last follow-up 11% (32/151) vs. 21.2% (10/91) among those who received only 5 to 6 mg/kg (P<0.042). Renal function (mean serum creatinine level) was similar at both 90 days and time of last follow-up. Safety review of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia did not differ. Conclusion Small changes in total rATG induction administered seem to significantly impact the incidence of rejection. Adequate rATG dosing is associated with improved rejection-free graft survival and should be achieved for all patients; doses should be rounded up when appropriate or additional doses should be administered if necessary.","2012-08-27","Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S11564597","Wolters Kluwer","0041-1337","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0b013e318257ad1a",NA,NA,"publishedVersion","325","330","94","4",TRUE,8,2012,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1963770431","https://openalex.org/W1963770431,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0b013e318257ad1a,1963770431,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22814328","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0b013e318257ad1a","article","https://openalex.org/W1971278669,https://openalex.org/W1996004092,https://openalex.org/W1996834922,https://openalex.org/W2018100390,https://openalex.org/W2022293788,https://openalex.org/W2023201732,https://openalex.org/W2029673669,https://openalex.org/W2082111678,https://openalex.org/W2087235200,https://openalex.org/W2092509345,https://openalex.org/W2170783570,https://openalex.org/W2916596946,https://openalex.org/W4253750716","https://openalex.org/W1486584413,https://openalex.org/W1569816628,https://openalex.org/W1963770431,https://openalex.org/W2052365623,https://openalex.org/W2087086071,https://openalex.org/W2113407187,https://openalex.org/W2126574399,https://openalex.org/W2589824098,https://openalex.org/W3031966738,https://openalex.org/W3136218469"

In sub-group analysis, r-ATG appeared to lower mortality in sensitized patients with panel reactive antibody of 10% or higher (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.71). r-ATG may provide a survival benefit in SHKT, especially in sensitized patients maintained on TAC/MPA/PRED at hospital discharge.","2018-05-01","Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S42270594","Elsevier BV","1053-2498","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2017.11.012","http://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053249817321137/pdf",NA,"publishedVersion","587","595","37","5",TRUE,8,2018,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2768217392","https://openalex.org/W2768217392,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2017.11.012,2768217392,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29198930","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2017.11.012","article","https://openalex.org/W1963898897,https://openalex.org/W1964681599,https://openalex.org/W1968255938,https://openalex.org/W1976230377,https://openalex.org/W1985552633,https://openalex.org/W2000531481,https://openalex.org/W2014752904,https://openalex.org/W2019622534,https://openalex.org/W2022293788,https://openalex.org/W2026009101,https://openalex.org/W2027511687,https://openalex.org/W2031668066,https://openalex.org/W2039905679,https://openalex.org/W2040775375,https://openalex.org/W2043185098,https://openalex.org/W2043250502,https://openalex.org/W2043363204,https://openalex.org/W2055543492,https://openalex.org/W2068240849,https://openalex.org/W2070037415,https://openalex.org/W2079830501,https://openalex.org/W2089166187,https://openalex.org/W2091851863,https://openalex.org/W2103383683,https://openalex.org/W2105086997,https://openalex.org/W2110802587,https://openalex.org/W2121690051,https://openalex.org/W2122532950,https://openalex.org/W2132220648,https://openalex.org/W2133842584,https://openalex.org/W2141895973,https://openalex.org/W2163048132,https://openalex.org/W2225927169,https://openalex.org/W2252994773,https://openalex.org/W2272767690,https://openalex.org/W2313204009,https://openalex.org/W2341139192,https://openalex.org/W2466301558,https://openalex.org/W2474685696,https://openalex.org/W2521467817,https://openalex.org/W2588367596,https://openalex.org/W2917983358","https://openalex.org/W2088206352,https://openalex.org/W2130909087,https://openalex.org/W2145587586,https://openalex.org/W2530626445,https://openalex.org/W2770916859,https://openalex.org/W2789550761,https://openalex.org/W3086255011,https://openalex.org/W3088212660,https://openalex.org/W3110238042,https://openalex.org/W4323922245"

She had immediate function achieved serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dl post day 4. Following a slow rise in the creatinine, first renal allograft biopsy performed on post op day 14 that showed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) involving arterioles and glomerular capillaries without any sign of rejection. The serological work up was negative for donor specific and antiphospholipid antibodies. The TMA was attributed to tacrolimus which was subsequently discontinued. It was replaced with sirolimus with loading dose of 10mg once and then 5 mg daily maintenance dose at day 21. At day 35, the patient was noted to have nephrotic range proteinuria, 12 gm/24 hrs. A second renal biopsy performed that revealed de novo focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with cellular and collapsing features, mild mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with immunoflourescence consistent with early recurrence of lupus nephritis ISN/RPS class 2. The etiology of cellular and collapsing FSGS was thought to be related to sirolimus based on timing of exposure and negative work up for secondary causes of collapsing FSGS. Sirolimus was switched to cyclosporine. At day 105, proteinuria decreased to 1.6 grams/day and serum creatinine leveled off 1.6 mg/dL.We report a case of possible sirolimus-induced collapsing FSGS in a renal transplant recipient who may have been predisposed to develop a podocytopathy possibly due to TMA and altered WT1 expression resulting from m-TOR exposure.","2011-01-01","Annals of Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S18427172","International Scientific Information Inc.","1425-9524","https://doi.org/10.12659/aot.881874",NA,NA,NA,"113","116","16","2",FALSE,7,2011,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1838189491","https://openalex.org/W1838189491,https://doi.org/10.12659/aot.881874,1838189491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21716195","https://doi.org/10.12659/aot.881874","article","NA","https://openalex.org/W593504957,https://openalex.org/W1838189491,https://openalex.org/W1894184984,https://openalex.org/W1903400040,https://openalex.org/W2031694281,https://openalex.org/W2126629494,https://openalex.org/W2353384028,https://openalex.org/W2916219914,https://openalex.org/W3029009186,https://openalex.org/W4229067153"

In this study we tested the hypothesis that association of pre-transplant renal function and post-transplant mortality varies among recipient subgroups.We queried the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database for adult patients (≥18 years of age) undergoing lung transplantation between May 2005 and March 2015. The study population (n = 15,540) was split into 3 groups (90 to 150, 60 to 89.9 and 30 to 59.9 ml/min/1.73 m2) based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) at the time of listing. We utilized multivariable inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazard models to compare the association of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) groups with mortality among recipient subgroups.Overall, there was an independent and graded inverse association between the estimated GFR (eGFR) and mortality, with the hazard of mortality significantly rising with listing eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The association between low eGFR and mortality was more consistent and stronger for older (>45 years), non-African-American and non-diabetic patients as well as those with low lung allocation score (LAS <40). Among the diagnosis groups, patients with vascular diseases had the strongest association between low eGFR and poor survival. Sensitivity analyses conducted using an alternate equation to estimate the GFR (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) supported these associations.Prognostic significance of pre-transplant renal functions varies significantly among recipient subgroups. It may be appropriate to develop a customized approach toward assessing and interpreting renal function to determine transplant candidacy.","2018-02-01","Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S42270594","Elsevier BV","1053-2498","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2017.08.006",NA,NA,NA,"275","282","37","2",FALSE,7,2018,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2742565980","https://openalex.org/W2742565980,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2017.08.006,2742565980,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28947250","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2017.08.006","article","https://openalex.org/W1543353471,https://openalex.org/W1606018897,https://openalex.org/W1972718711,https://openalex.org/W1978412687,https://openalex.org/W1981341984,https://openalex.org/W1990802861,https://openalex.org/W2003581719,https://openalex.org/W2009068379,https://openalex.org/W2019873452,https://openalex.org/W2020554985,https://openalex.org/W2031668066,https://openalex.org/W2034328214,https://openalex.org/W2043363204,https://openalex.org/W2055864845,https://openalex.org/W2060270098,https://openalex.org/W2062208380,https://openalex.org/W2070880529,https://openalex.org/W2074715790,https://openalex.org/W2077668716,https://openalex.org/W2081530857,https://openalex.org/W2118758107,https://openalex.org/W2121690051,https://openalex.org/W2122532950,https://openalex.org/W2134672034,https://openalex.org/W2147189123,https://openalex.org/W2152073293,https://openalex.org/W2155965977,https://openalex.org/W2156543126,https://openalex.org/W2167692119,https://openalex.org/W2169360466,https://openalex.org/W2169634314,https://openalex.org/W2252994773,https://openalex.org/W2280330931,https://openalex.org/W2345878938,https://openalex.org/W2516314951,https://openalex.org/W4250934836","https://openalex.org/W2057091235,https://openalex.org/W2060270098,https://openalex.org/W2079680494,https://openalex.org/W2119954546,https://openalex.org/W2129213988,https://openalex.org/W2154790935,https://openalex.org/W2572837865,https://openalex.org/W3007732862,https://openalex.org/W3080096616,https://openalex.org/W3206580393"

There is lack of data regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with RD and the role of simultaneous lung-kidney transplant (SLuKi) among these patients.The United Network of Organ Sharing database was queried for adult patients (18 years or older) undergoing LT between 1995 and 2014. Pretransplant RD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the time of transplant listing. The recipient, donor, and procedure-related variables and survival were compared among patients with RD undergoing LT alone (split on the basis of eGFR impairment: 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) vs those with SLuKi.The frequency of pretransplant RD was 5.42% (n = 1337). Patients with RD have significantly higher 1-year mortality (23.2% vs 15%; P < .001) and 3-year mortality (38.3% vs 28%; P < .001) than patients with eGFR > 60mL/min/1.73 m2. The proportion of patients with RD undergoing SLuKi was 2.84% (38 of 1337). Both the number and proportion of patients undergoing SLuKi progressively increased during the study period, especially in the lung allocation score era (30 of 38 SLuKi patients in the post lung allocation score era (linear R2 = 0.641, P < .001). The patients who underwent SLuKi were significantly younger, had lower body mass index, serum albumin, and listing eGFR (P < .001 for all comparisons). Patients with SLuKi were more likely to have cystic fibrosis or vascular diseases as the underlying diagnosis (29.7% vs 13.8%, P = .004). Despite higher need of early dialysis support after transplant, there was no difference in the 30-day, 1-year, or 3-year survival between the 2 groups.A significant proportion of LT candidates have a pre-existing RD, and this comorbidity is associated with significantly worse 1- and 3-year survival.

However, its benefits in the setting of contemporary maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus/mycophenolic acid (TAC/MPA) are unknown.We compared post-transplant mortality among three induction therapy strategies (r-ATG vs IL2-RA vs no induction) in a retrospective cohort analysis of heart transplant recipients maintained on TAC/MPA in the Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) database between the years 2006 and 2015. We used a multivariable model adjusting for clinically important co-morbidities, and a propensity score analysis using the inverse probability weighted (IPW) method in the final analysis.In multivariable IPW analysis, r-ATG (HR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.05-1.46, P = 0.01) remained significantly associated with a higher mortality. There was a trend toward having a higher mortality in the IL2-RA (HR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.00-1.24, P = 0.06) group. Subgroup analyses failed to show a patient survival benefit in using either r-ATG or IL2-RA among any of the subgroups analyzed.In this contemporary cohort of heart transplant recipients receiving TAC/MPA, neither r-ATG nor IL2-RA were associated with a survival benefit. On the contrary, adjusted analyses showed a significantly higher mortality in the r-ATG group and a trend toward higher mortality in the IL2-RA group. While caution is needed in interpreting treatment effects in an observational cohort, these data call into question the benefit of induction therapy as a common practice and highlight the need for more studies.","2019-07-19","Clinical transplantation","https://openalex.org/S4210215907","Wiley-Blackwell","0902-0063","https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.13651",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,6,2019,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2952093667","https://openalex.org/W2952093667,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.13651,2952093667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230375","https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.13651","article","https://openalex.org/W1963898897,https://openalex.org/W1964681599,https://openalex.org/W2014752904,https://openalex.org/W2021294029,https://openalex.org/W2031668066,https://openalex.org/W2039905679,https://openalex.org/W2043363204,https://openalex.org/W2055543492,https://openalex.org/W2060316606,https://openalex.org/W2068081034,https://openalex.org/W2091851863,https://openalex.org/W2092180284,https://openalex.org/W2103371988,https://openalex.org/W2105086997,https://openalex.org/W2110818436,https://openalex.org/W2121690051,https://openalex.org/W2122532950,https://openalex.org/W2132220648,https://openalex.org/W2133842584,https://openalex.org/W2141895973,https://openalex.org/W2152996421,https://openalex.org/W2163048132,https://openalex.org/W2168499787,https://openalex.org/W2518176410,https://openalex.org/W2917983358","https://openalex.org/W1502216456,https://openalex.org/W1890838281,https://openalex.org/W1982399324,https://openalex.org/W2059993851,https://openalex.org/W2066765076,https://openalex.org/W2080813773,https://openalex.org/W2123622776,https://openalex.org/W2215257620,https://openalex.org/W2952093667,https://openalex.org/W4200605501"

The differential impact of the pandemic on access to liver transplantation was assessed.Disparities in organ access and transplant outcomes among vulnerable populations have served as obstacles in liver transplantation.Using UNOS STARfile data, adult waitlisted candidates were identified from March 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 (n = 21,702 pandemic) and March 1, 2019 to November 30, 2019 (n = 22,797 pre-pandemic), and further categorized and analyzed by time periods: March to May (Period 1), June to August (Period 2), and September to November (Period 3). Comparisons between pandemic and pre-pandemic groups included: Minority status, demographics, diagnosis, MELD, insurance type, and transplant center characteristics. Liver transplant centers (n = 113) were divided into tertiles by volume (small, medium, large) for further analyses. Multivariable logistic regression was fitted to assess odds of transplant. Competing risk regression was used to predict probability of removal from the waitlist due to transplantation or death and sickness. Additional temporal analyses were performed to assess changes in outcomes over the course of the pandemic.During Period 1 of the pandemic, Minorities showed greater reduction in both listing (-14% vs -12% Whites), and transplant (-15% vs -7% Whites), despite a higher median MELD at transplant (23 vs 20 Whites, P < 0.001). Of candidates with public insurance, Minorities demonstrated an 18.5% decrease in transplants during Period 1 (vs -8% Whites). Although large programs increased transplants during Period 1, accounting for 61.5% of liver transplants versus 53.4% pre-pandemic (P < 0.001), Minorities constituted significantly fewer transplants at these programs during this time period (27.7% pandemic vs 31.7% pre-pandemic, P = 0.04). Although improvements in disparities in candidate listings, removals, and transplants were observed during Periods 2 and 3, the adjusted odds ratio of transplant for Minorities was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.96, P = 0.001) over the entire pandemic period.COVID-19's effect on access to liver transplantation has been ubiquitous. However, Minorities, especially those with public insurance, have been disproportionately affected. Importantly, despite the uncertainty and challenges, our systems have remarkable resiliency, as demonstrated by the temporal improvements observed during Periods 2 and 3. As the pandemic persists, and the aftermath ensues, health care systems must consciously strive to identify and equitably serve vulnerable populations.","2021-06-25","Annals of Surgery","https://openalex.org/S157664895","Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","0003-4932","https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004994",NA,NA,NA,"427","433","274","3",FALSE,6,2021,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3173903288","https://openalex.org/W3173903288,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004994,3173903288,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34183513,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8354487","https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004994","article","https://openalex.org/W49596168,https://openalex.org/W1964183098,https://openalex.org/W1971335799,https://openalex.org/W1987463134,https://openalex.org/W2006171903,https://openalex.org/W2047582541,https://openalex.org/W2063430729,https://openalex.org/W2112015669,https://openalex.org/W2328718085,https://openalex.org/W2735849488,https://openalex.org/W2754160328,https://openalex.org/W2921438895,https://openalex.org/W2949622229,https://openalex.org/W2977500454,https://openalex.org/W3012581356,https://openalex.org/W3015807396,https://openalex.org/W3015937556,https://openalex.org/W3016474181,https://openalex.org/W3020264722,https://openalex.org/W3042339743,https://openalex.org/W3089332324,https://openalex.org/W3092114411,https://openalex.org/W3099105066,https://openalex.org/W3120518670,https://openalex.org/W3122609186,https://openalex.org/W3131268672","https://openalex.org/W881425895,https://openalex.org/W1543256914,https://openalex.org/W2262524499,https://openalex.org/W2314999510,https://openalex.org/W3012237406,https://openalex.org/W4212977085,https://openalex.org/W4226042254,https://openalex.org/W4253083856,https://openalex.org/W4311068385,https://openalex.org/W4322729359"

During the study period, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was between 95% and 100%. Of 29 635 patients who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 1 August 2021 and 30 October 2021, in the Banner Health Care System, the study cohort was split into 4213 adult patients who received Cas-Imd mAb (1200 mg) treatment compared to a PS-matched 4213 untreated patients. The primary outcomes were the incidence of all-cause hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality within 30 days of Cas-Imd mAb administration or Delta variant infection.Compared to the PS-matched untreated cohort, the Cas-Imd mAb cohort had significantly lower all-cause hospitalization (4.2% vs 17.6%; difference in percentages, -13.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -14.7 to -12.0]; P < .001), ICU admission (0.3% vs 2.8%; difference, -2.4 [95% CI, -3.0 to -1.9]; P < .001), and mortality (0.2% vs 2.0%; difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -2.3 to -1.3]; P < .001) within 30 days. The Cas-Imd mAb treatment was associated with lower rate of hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22 [95% CI, .19-.26]; P < .001) and mortality (HR, 0.11 [95% CI, .06-.21]; P < .001).Cas-Imd mAb treatment was associated with a lower hospitalization rate, ICU admission, and mortality within 30 days among patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.","2022-04-12","Open Forum Infectious Diseases","https://openalex.org/S2735126445","Oxford University Press","2328-8957","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac186",NA,"cc-by-nc-nd","publishedVersion",NA,NA,"9","7",TRUE,6,2022,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4223491415","https://openalex.org/W4223491415,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac186,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35791354","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac186","article","https://openalex.org/W2000445173,https://openalex.org/W2122771444,https://openalex.org/W2152849583,https://openalex.org/W2793811202,https://openalex.org/W3008443627,https://openalex.org/W3028583791,https://openalex.org/W3111431752,https://openalex.org/W3131688063,https://openalex.org/W3161034134,https://openalex.org/W3182094313,https://openalex.org/W3184172540,https://openalex.org/W3185801930,https://openalex.org/W3193601449,https://openalex.org/W3198860035,https://openalex.org/W3200130214,https://openalex.org/W3200299601,https://openalex.org/W3208556307,https://openalex.org/W3212357575,https://openalex.org/W4205329284,https://openalex.org/W4212988737,https://openalex.org/W4225505755,https://openalex.org/W4225826670,https://openalex.org/W4225854071,https://openalex.org/W4226004814,https://openalex.org/W4237585208","https://openalex.org/W1516595110,https://openalex.org/W1548660409,https://openalex.org/W1888779397,https://openalex.org/W1999374750,https://openalex.org/W2026094606,https://openalex.org/W2490521022,https://openalex.org/W2515906920,https://openalex.org/W2900720613,https://openalex.org/W3025172794,https://openalex.org/W4281570920"

There is a paucity of data evaluating SLK outcomes in patients undergoing LT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our aim was to compare outcomes between patients with HCC who underwent SLK and those who received SLK for other indications.We performed a retrospective analysis of adult recipients receiving SLK between 2002 and 2013 from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry. The primary outcome was posttransplant mortality. Patient survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and predictors of mortality were identified using proportional Cox hazard regression models. Propensity score matching was performed between SLK-HCC and SLK in the absence of HCC (SLK-A) groups to reduce confounding.Between 2002 and 2013, 186 HCC patients underwent SLK-HCC and 3599 patients underwent SLK-A. The 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 89.0% and 76.7% in the SLK-HCC group and 84.5% and 76.3% in the SLK-A group (P = 0.20).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) introduced a major change in the kidney allocation system (KAS) policy on March 15, 2021, removing Donation Service Area (DSA) and OPTN region, introducing circles of a radius 250 nautical miles around donor hospitals, and adding allocation proximity points (the KAS-250 policy). The OPTN 6-mo postimplementation report indicated that number of deceased donor kidney transplants increased, whereas waitlist mortality and discard rate both decreased.3 In this retrospective study, we evaluated kidney discard patterns over time and their associations with the COVID-19 pandemic and the KAS-250 policy changes using OPTN data from October 31, 2008, through March 31, 2022, divided into 4 eras: (i) pre-KAS era: October 31, 2008, to December 3, 2014; (ii) KAS era: December 4, 2014, to March 10, 2020; (iii) COVID-19 only era: March 11, 2020, to March 14, 2021, covering the first year of COVID-19 pandemic until the start of the KAS-250 policy; and (iv) KAS-250 era: March 15, 2021, to March 31, 2022, covering the first year of the KAS-250 policy implementation and overlaps with the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean monthly discard rate increased significantly across the 4 eras: from 18.47% to 19.66% to 21.81% to 24.78% (P < 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons, Tables S1–S2, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C544). Our trends analysis (Figure 1) revealed that discard rate remained stable around its respective mean values within the pre-KAS and KAS eras (similar to previously reported),4 but it started increasing, albeit slowly, in the COVID-19 only era (trend P value: 0.30), and the increase accelerated in the KAS-250 era (trend P value: 0.01), resulting in a peak rate of 28.34% in November 2021 followed by a downward trend concluding with 23.40% in March 2022. Discard rate, however, was not uniformly distributed across the United States (Figure 2). Although the 30% threshold was exceeded in only 1 DSA (within OPTN Region 2—Northeast), in each of the pre-KAS and KAS eras, it was exceeded in 5 DSAs (within OPTN Regions 3—Southeast,5—Northeast, and 9—West) in the COVID-19 only era and in 10 DSAs (within OPTN Regions 2—Northeast, 3—Southeast, 11—East, 5—West, 6—Northwest, and 10—Midwest) in the KAS-250 era.FIGURE 1.: Discard rate trends for deceased donor kidneys in the United States by donor recovery year and major events (kidney allocation policy changes and COVID-19 pandemic). DSA, donation service area; KAS, kidney allocation system.FIGURE 2.: Geographic changes in deceased donor kidney discard rate in the United States and its evolution over 4 eras. Discard rate is calculated for each OPO’s DSA in aggregate. State and county boundaries are indicated in thick and thin white colored lines, respectively. DSA, donation service area; KAS, kidney allocation system; OPO, organ procurement organization.Across the 4 eras, the proportion of kidneys recovered for transplantation with high Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI), namely, KDPI 35% to 85% and KDPI >85%, increased steadily from 47.82% and 13.18% in the pre-KAS era to 51.99% and 16.18%, respectively, in the KAS-250 era (Tables S1–S2, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C544). These trends coupled with rising discard rates for KDPI 35% to 85% and KDPI >85% kidneys (from 19.65% and 56.39% in the pre-KAS era to 23.93% and 66.48%, respectively, in the KAS-250 era) (Figure S1, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C544) mostly accounted for the overall increasing trend observed in the KAS-250 era (Figure 1). “No recipient located—list exhausted” has become an increasingly dominant reason for discards (20.53% in the pre-KAS versus 61.84% in the KAS-250 era) and surpassed abnormal biopsy findings by a factor of 4 in the KAS-250 era (14.50% versus 61.84%). Based on a propensity score (using inverse probability of treatment weighting) adjusted multivariable mixed effect logistic regression (accounting for the random effects of organ procurement organizations [OPOs]), the odds of discard, compared with the pre-KAS era (the control group), increased by 2% (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio: 0.95-1.09) during the KAS era, by 12% (CI: 1.03-1.22) during the COVID-19 only era, and by 24% (CI: 1.13-1.36) during the KAS-250 era (Table S3, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C544). It is not easy to pin down a single reason for recent increase in discard rates. Potential explanations include (1) the enhanced strive of OPOs to expand the donor pool and to recover more (high KDPI) organs for transplant4,5,6; (2) COVID-19 pandemic-related strain on health care systems (eg, lack of hospital beds, COVID-19–infected providers and candidates, socioeconomical disruptions, insufficient staffing and machines in dialysis units)7,8,9,10,11; (3) increased risk averse behavior of transplant center during the COVID-19 pandemic2,6,12; (4) the impact of KAS-250 policy (difficulties in transporting organs, prolonged cold ischemia, lack of machine perfusion devices sharing between OPOs)13; (5) lack of efficient expedited placement of hard-to-place kidneys)14; and (6) the growing number of potential donors with COVID-19 infection and a lack of high-quality evidence to guide decisions regarding deceased donation.5 Knowing that “No recipient located—list exhausted” has become the major reason for discards in the KAS-250 era, elimination of logistic barriers, refining kidney allocation inefficiencies, and the OPTN’s close monitoring on transplant metrics will be critical in effective handling of discards.

There are limited data on the characteristics and outcomes of HUS in pediatric and adult kidney transplant recipients in the United States. Methods This study included all renal transplant recipients identified with HUS (N = 1233) as a cause of end-stage renal disease between 1987 and 2013 using the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database. The cohort was divided into 2 age groups: pediatric (N = 447) and adult (N = 786). Main outcomes were acute rejection rate at 1 year, allograft and patient survival, and recurrence of HUS posttransplant. Both age groups were then compared with a propensity score (PS) (1:2 ratio) matched control group with an alternative primary kidney disease (non-HUS cohort: pediatric [N = 829] and adult [N = 1547]). Results In pediatric cohort, when compared with the PS-matched controls, acute rejection, death censored allograft, and patient survival was similar in the HUS group. However, in the adult cohort, the graft and patient survivals were significantly worse in the HUS group. The HUS was associated with allograft loss (hazard ratio, 1.40, 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.71) in adult recipients. Patients with HUS recurrence had significantly lower allograft and patient survival rates compared with the nonrecurrent group in both age groups. Acute rejection was one of the major predictor of HUS recurrence in adults (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-5.60). Calcineurin inhibitors were not associated HUS recurrence in both age groups. Conclusions Pediatric HUS patients, unlike adult recipients, have similar outcomes compared with the PS-matched controls. Recurrence of HUS is associated with poor allograft and patient survivals in pediatric and adult patients. Use of calcineurin inhibitors seem to be safe as a part of maintenance immunosuppression posttransplantation. A comprehensive national registry is urgently needed.","2015-11-01","Transplantation direct","https://openalex.org/S2764430067","Wolters Kluwer","2373-8731","https://doi.org/10.1097/txd.0000000000000555",NA,"cc-by-nc-nd","publishedVersion","e41","e41","1","10",TRUE,3,2015,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2404597328","https://openalex.org/W2404597328,https://doi.org/10.1097/txd.0000000000000555,2404597328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26949736,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/4775084","https://doi.org/10.1097/txd.0000000000000555","article","https://openalex.org/W1510290752,https://openalex.org/W1574141134,https://openalex.org/W1686008017,https://openalex.org/W1827404249,https://openalex.org/W1968451660,https://openalex.org/W1982003857,https://openalex.org/W1985447064,https://openalex.org/W1998844302,https://openalex.org/W1999827339,https://openalex.org/W2005741975,https://openalex.org/W2006140229,https://openalex.org/W2014565595,https://openalex.org/W2016810124,https://openalex.org/W2029886021,https://openalex.org/W2031700420,https://openalex.org/W2035128042,https://openalex.org/W2045528835,https://openalex.org/W2046913623,https://openalex.org/W2047596750,https://openalex.org/W2056659246,https://openalex.org/W2074462360,https://openalex.org/W2079142360,https://openalex.org/W2106675927,https://openalex.org/W2121690051,https://openalex.org/W2123170559,https://openalex.org/W2123753762,https://openalex.org/W2126092981,https://openalex.org/W2143431905,https://openalex.org/W2145984770,https://openalex.org/W2149943632,https://openalex.org/W2158943356,https://openalex.org/W2159584550,https://openalex.org/W2163243965,https://openalex.org/W2165494356,https://openalex.org/W2166637331,https://openalex.org/W2171275709,https://openalex.org/W2312509578,https://openalex.org/W2398251577,https://openalex.org/W2405183840","https://openalex.org/W2022392719,https://openalex.org/W2064447907,https://openalex.org/W2121372226,https://openalex.org/W2793590385,https://openalex.org/W2804529914,https://openalex.org/W3017329712,https://openalex.org/W3028842023,https://openalex.org/W3038392370,https://openalex.org/W3154231528,https://openalex.org/W3162666314"

The KAS was designed to improve organ equity and graft-recipient longevity matching. However, estimated wait-time to deceased donor transplantation is difficult to predict post-KAS.Using the Kidney-Pancreas Simulated Allocation Model software (KPSAM), a program that the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network uses to assess policy proposals, we compared the kidney allocations of both the new (post-KAS) and old policies (pre-KAS) (10 iterations for each group; total N = 204,148) and estimated wait-time based on blood type, duration of dialysis exposure, and calculated panel-reactive antibody (CPRA).The simulations revealed that estimated median (25(th) and 75(th) percentile) waiting time in transplanted recipients decreased from 2.3 (1.2, 3.8) years in the old allocation to 1.8 (0.8, 3.4) years in the new allocation system. The rate of transplantations performed within the first year of wait-listing increased from 20.7% to 31.3%. The KPSAM resulted in more transplantations in recipients with more than 5 years of dialysis exposure (26.5% to 37.4%), longevity matching (12.2% to 17.5%), blood group B (12.6% to 17.2%), and high CPRA ≥98% (1.9% to 4.3%) in post-KAS compared with pre-KAS simulations.Based on the KPSAM results, it was projected that post-KAS wait-time in transplanted recipients might decrease approximately 6 months (22%) across all CPRA categories. It might be related to the KAS awarding waiting time points for prelisting dialysis time and priority points awarded based on CPRA (bolus effect).","2016-07-01","Transplantation Proceedings","https://openalex.org/S146061289","Elsevier BV","0041-1345","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2016.03.041",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,3,2016,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2511826639","https://openalex.org/W2511826639,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2016.03.041,2511826639,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27569922","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2016.03.041","article","https://openalex.org/W1516189339,https://openalex.org/W2135354390,https://openalex.org/W2139972161,https://openalex.org/W2295343146","https://openalex.org/W1212051013,https://openalex.org/W1983580490,https://openalex.org/W1989571268,https://openalex.org/W2111523271,https://openalex.org/W2123864058,https://openalex.org/W2169105348,https://openalex.org/W2512401801,https://openalex.org/W2513361503,https://openalex.org/W2524838196,https://openalex.org/W2554785203,https://openalex.org/W2587841779,https://openalex.org/W2767044582,https://openalex.org/W2884725212,https://openalex.org/W2904920816,https://openalex.org/W2921355937,https://openalex.org/W2922206086,https://openalex.org/W2973202816,https://openalex.org/W3129136831,https://openalex.org/W3136749505,https://openalex.org/W3175273273"

UNOS kidney simulation model (KPSAM), which played a crucial role in the 2014 U.S. kidney allocation policy update, is also available to the general public as an executable file. However, this format offers little flexibility to its users in trying out different policy proposals. We describe the development of a discrete-event simulation model as an alternative to KPSAM. It is similar to KPSAM in incorporating many clinical and operational details. On the other hand, it offers more flexibility in evaluating various policy proposals and runs significantly faster than KPSAM due to its efficient use of modern computing technologies. Simulated results closely match actual U.S. kidney transplantation outcomes, building confidence in the accuracy and validity of the model.","2019-12-01",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://doi.org/10.1109/wsc40007.2019.9004914",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,3,2019,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3008986441","https://openalex.org/W3008986441,https://doi.org/10.1109/wsc40007.2019.9004914,3008986441","https://doi.org/10.1109/wsc40007.2019.9004914","article","https://openalex.org/W1568055897,https://openalex.org/W1984702972,https://openalex.org/W2120213019,https://openalex.org/W2126059922,https://openalex.org/W2168866040,https://openalex.org/W2734454829,https://openalex.org/W3139421866,https://openalex.org/W4232903244,https://openalex.org/W4235698906,https://openalex.org/W4238919170,https://openalex.org/W4240160638,https://openalex.org/W4246938300,https://openalex.org/W4250351772,https://openalex.org/W4255457535","https://openalex.org/W2084149893,https://openalex.org/W2372524402,https://openalex.org/W2378019284,https://openalex.org/W2382568077,https://openalex.org/W2805924177,https://openalex.org/W2891467435,https://openalex.org/W2992668836,https://openalex.org/W3030384628,https://openalex.org/W3030709858,https://openalex.org/W4313500061"

Remaining patients with CKD with GFR of 45–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 may not be suitable for SHKT. Nevertheless, applying these criteria to HT alone recipients between 2000 and 2019, approximately 33% of them with an estimated GFR of 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 pretransplant (Supplementary Table S1), not considered as eligible for SHKT, may still be at risk of developing end-stage renal disease. Therefore, a personalized computer-aided model to predict the possibility of advanced kidney failure in early post-transplant period is needed to identify at-risk candidates.In this study, we developed a machine learning (random forest [RF])–based algorithm to predict composite renal outcomes (CRO defined as dependence on chronic dialysis, GFR <20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, or having received a kidney transplant) among adult HT recipients at risk (GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) at post-transplant 1 year. We also built a web-based decision tool based on the RF model (Figure 1).

The characteristics of the study cohort and corresponding deceased donors are found in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2. The final study cohort included 19,861 patients, of which 783 (3.9%) had incident CRO.

Open table in a new tab Predictors of Post-HT CROsA total of 15 predictors of post-HT ROC were selected by the RBFOpt library and sorted by RF feature importance score (Supplementary Table S3) among 39 variables in the United Network for Organ Sharing-STAR Dataset (Supplementary Table S4).Performance of the RF ModelThe final RF model performed with a C-statistic of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67–0.74) (Supplementary Figure S3). At the fixed sensitivity of 80.0%, the model resulted in 46.2% specificity, 97.8% negative predictive value, and 8.1% positive predictive value. For the given negative predictive value performance, our RF model mislabeled 2.2% of cases (=100%–97.8%). On the basis of 2019 statistics, the absolute and relative reduction in risk prediction was 3.9% (=6.1%–2.2%) and 64% (=[6.1%–2.2% / 6.1%] × 100), respectively.Robustness of the ModelTo find the robustness of our model, we conducted 2 separate analyses. First, we trained the RF model using a data set that excluded patients who died in the no-CRO group; the model resulted in a C-statistic of 0.71 (95% CI 0.69–0.75). At the fixed sensitivity of 80.0%, the model had 46.3% specificity, 98.1% negative predictive value, and 8.0% positive predictive value. In the second analysis, we developed a RF survival model by treating the death event in the first year as a competing event to CRO occurrence and reported the accuracy of CRO prediction at 1 year. The competing event RF model classified CRO with 70.6% accuracy.Characteristics of the Patients Who DiedBecause post-transplant mortality is relevant to the analysis, we also described comparative characteristics of the patients who died in both groups within 1 year post-transplant (Supplementary Table S5). The post-HT patients with CRO who died were more likely to have diabetes and worse Karnofsky scores and require dialysis pretransplant than the patients in the no-CRO group who died.DiscussionOur decision tool with a web-based interface is practical as it uses readily existing recipient pretransplant variables and provides a personalized risk of developing CRO within 1 year of HT. The performance RF model did not significantly change with by censoring death in both robustness analyses.The variables selected in the RF model mostly align with previously described factors, including pretransplant renal function and need for renal replacement treatment, age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, functional status, ventricular assist device requirement, and pretransplant cardiac index.4Habib P.J.

Clinical judgment (thorough physical examination and history taking, medication review, trending renal function on multiple data points, renal imaging, urine analysis, renal biopsy findings if available, etc.) should play a more significant role when the RF model predicts a positive outcome owing to the high false-positive rate and low positive predictive value. This scenario is related to the inability to capture reversibility in certain features (such as postoperative improvement in renal perfusion and renal function), uncertainty around donor quality, and perioperative course.We also evaluated our RF model with an external cohort (an external validation), 353 patients who underwent SHKT between January 10, 2019, and September 30, 2020. Our predictive model classified 93% of SHKT patient into the positive class and 7% of SHKT patients into the negative class, which suggests that the clinical re-evaluation of 7% of patients for SHKT eligibility is necessary.Strengths of this study include large sample size and utilization of the RF method with a multidimensional dataset. Nevertheless, the limitations are as follows: (i) potential bias inherent to the observational study design owing to unmeasured patient characteristics; (ii) vulnerability to significant changes in heart donor allocation policies affecting center practice and patient characteristics; and (iii) not capturing uncertainties potentially introducing prolonged AKI resulting from donor characteristics and postoperative complications.In conclusion, the proposed web-based decision tool powered by an RF-based machine learning method is an objective and cross-validated tool for patient-level identification of CRO risk among at-risk HT candidates.DisclosureThe author, JLG, served as a consultant in the advisory board of Pfizer, Inc., Alnylam, Eidos Therapeutics, and Sarepta.

Nevertheless, applying these criteria to HT alone recipients between 2000 and 2019, approximately 33% of them with an estimated GFR of 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 pretransplant (Supplementary Table S1), not considered as eligible for SHKT, may still be at risk of developing end-stage renal disease. Therefore, a personalized computer-aided model to predict the possibility of advanced kidney failure in early post-transplant period is needed to identify at-risk candidates. In this study, we developed a machine learning (random forest [RF])–based algorithm to predict composite renal outcomes (CRO defined as dependence on chronic dialysis, GFR <20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, or having received a kidney transplant) among adult HT recipients at risk (GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) at post-transplant 1 year. We also built a web-based decision tool based on the RF model (Figure 1). The details regarding the study cohort selection (Supplementary Figure S1) and the methods are provided in the Supplementary Materials. ResultsCharacteristics of the Study CohortIn this retrospective study, we analyzed a cohort of adult recipients who received HT alone transplants (regardless of listing intention) between January 1, 2000, and September 30, 2019, using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network national registry, which included 19,861 adult HT recipients with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at listing and/or pretransplant.The incidence of the CRO at 1 year between 2000 and 2019 is found in Supplementary Figure S2 (ranging from 2.2% to 6.1%). The characteristics of the study cohort and corresponding deceased donors are found in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2. The final study cohort included 19,861 patients, of which 783 (3.9%) had incident CRO. The 1-year survival among the patients who developed post-HT CRO (71.0%) was significantly lower compared with the ones who did not (88.3%) (log-rank P < 0.001).Table 1Characteristics and outcomes of the HT alone recipients (eGFR ≤60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at listing and/or before transplant) between 2000 and 2019 by composite renal outcomes at 1 year in the United StatesRecipient characteristicsWhole cohortNo-CROCROP valueaP value applies to the comparison of no-CRO and CRO groups.n (%)19,86119,708 (96.1)783 (3.9)Age, median (IQR) yr59 (51–64)59 (51–64)59 (52–64)0.17Sex (male)14,761 (74.3)14,195 (74.4)566 (72.3)0.18Race<0.001 White14,395 (72.5)13,883 (72.8)512 (65.4) Black3415 (17.2)3215 (16.9)200 (25.5) Hispanic1302 (6.6)1257 (6.6)45 (5.8) Asian524 (2.6)505 (2.6)19 (2.4) Other225 (1.1)218 (1.1)7 (0.9)Recipient height (cm)173.9 ± 9.8173.9 ± 9.8173.4 ± 10.10.16Recipient weight (kg)83.4 ± 17.483.3 ± 17.485.2 ± 17.80.003Body mass index (kg/m2)27.5 ± 4.827.4 ± 4.828.2 ± 5.0<0.001History of diabetes<0.001 No13,932 (70.2)13,463 (70.6)469 (59.9) Type I382 (1.9)362 (1.9)20 (2.6) Type II5547 (27.9)5253 (27.5)294 (37.6)Etiology of cardiomyopathy0.34 Ischemic7815 (39.4)7510 (39.4)305 (39.0) Nonischemic7433 (37.4)7155 (37.5)278 (35.5) Congenital416(2.1)401 (2.1)15 (1.9) OtherbOther: restrictive cardiomyopathy, congenital, arrhythmia, valvular, and heart transplant-related diagnosis.4197 (21.1)4012 (21.0)185 (23.6)Previous HT, n (%)695 (3.5)663 (3.5)32 (4.1)0.36Cardiac output, l/min4.54 ± 1.464.54 ± 1.464.76 ± 1.53<0.001Cardiac index, l/min per m22.31 ± 0.702.30 ± 0.702.21 ± 0.67<0.001Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mm Hg18.8 ± 8.618.8 ± 8.618.5 ± 8.40.33Pulmonary artery mean pressure, mm Hg28.3 ± 9.928.3 ± 9.928.1 ± 9.30.58Mechanical ventilation requirement462 (2.3)437 (2.3)25 (3.2)0.10ECMO207 (1.0)190 (1.0)17 (2.2)0.002IABP1536 (7.7)1463 (7.7)73 (9.3)0.09VAD<0.001 None11,698 (58.9)11,306 (59.3)392 (50.1) LVAD alone6530 (32.9)6234 (32.7)296 (37.8) RVAD/BiVAD/TAH864 (4.4)797 (4.2)67 (8.6) Unknown769 (3.9)741 (3.9)28 (3.6)eGFR, ml/min per 1.73 m2 at listing (if not on dialysis)54.3 ± 17.654.5 ± 17.550.9 ± 18.7<0.001eGFR, ml/min per 1.73 m2 before transplant (if not on dialysis)53.3 ± 17.654.5 ± 17.645.8 ± 17.0<0.001eGFR ratio (before transplant/wait listing)1.10 ± 0.901.10 ± 0.910.99 ± 0.45<0.001Dialysis at listing, n (%)370 (1.9)339 (1.8)31 (4.0)<0.001Dialysis before transplant, n (%)1038 (5.2)907 (4.8)131 (16.7)<0.001Functional status by Karnofsky score before transplant, %<0.001 80–1003309 (16.7)3213 (16.8)96 (12.3) 51–796839 (34.4)6603 (34.6)316 (40.4) 0–508237 (41.5)7824 (41.0)396 (50.6) Unknown1476 (7.4)1438 (7.5)38 (4.9)UNOS region<0.001 1989 (4.5)865 (4.5)33 (4.2) 22371 (11.9)2229 (11.7)142 (18.1) 32233 (11.4)2177 (11.4)56 (7.2) 42340 (11.8)2252 (11.8)88 (11.2) 53136 (15.8)3017 (15.8)119 (15.2) 6656 (3.3)640 (3.4)16 (2.0) 71900 (9.6)1831 (9.6)69 (8.8) 81107 (5.6)1067 (5.6)40 (5.1) 91202 (6.1)1127 (5.9)75 (9.6) 101626 (8.2)1583 (8.3)43 (5.5) 112392 (12.0)2290 (12.0)102 (13.0)Waitlisted time (including inactive status), median (IQR), d87 (25–251)87 (25–250)104 (27–285)Post-transplant patient survival at 1 yr (based on Kaplan Meier estimates), %87.388.371.0<0.001Composite renal outcome incidence within 1 yr of heart transplantation, mean (the year 2000, the year 2019), %3.9 (2.6–6.1)Data are presented as n (%), median (IQR) as appropriate.BiVAD, biventricular assist device; CABG, coronary artery bypass graft; CRO, composite renal outcome; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HT, heart transplant; IABP, intra-aortic balloon pump; IQR, interquartile range; LV, left ventricular; LVAD, left ventricular assist device; TAH, total artificial heart; UNOS, United Network of Organ Sharing; VAD, ventricular assist device.a P value applies to the comparison of no-CRO and CRO groups.b Other: restrictive cardiomyopathy, congenital, arrhythmia, valvular, and heart transplant-related diagnosis. Open table in a new tab Predictors of Post-HT CROsA total of 15 predictors of post-HT ROC were selected by the RBFOpt library and sorted by RF feature importance score (Supplementary Table S3) among 39 variables in the United Network for Organ Sharing-STAR Dataset (Supplementary Table S4).Performance of the RF ModelThe final RF model performed with a C-statistic of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67–0.74) (Supplementary Figure S3). At the fixed sensitivity of 80.0%, the model resulted in 46.2% specificity, 97.8% negative predictive value, and 8.1% positive predictive value. For the given negative predictive value performance, our RF model mislabeled 2.2% of cases (=100%–97.8%). On the basis of 2019 statistics, the absolute and relative reduction in risk prediction was 3.9% (=6.1%–2.2%) and 64% (=[6.1%–2.2% / 6.1%] × 100), respectively.Robustness of the ModelTo find the robustness of our model, we conducted 2 separate analyses. First, we trained the RF model using a data set that excluded patients who died in the no-CRO group; the model resulted in a C-statistic of 0.71 (95% CI 0.69–0.75). At the fixed sensitivity of 80.0%, the model had 46.3% specificity, 98.1% negative predictive value, and 8.0% positive predictive value. In the second analysis, we developed a RF survival model by treating the death event in the first year as a competing event to CRO occurrence and reported the accuracy of CRO prediction at 1 year. The competing event RF model classified CRO with 70.6% accuracy.Characteristics of the Patients Who DiedBecause post-transplant mortality is relevant to the analysis, we also described comparative characteristics of the patients who died in both groups within 1 year post-transplant (Supplementary Table S5). The post-HT patients with CRO who died were more likely to have diabetes and worse Karnofsky scores and require dialysis pretransplant than the patients in the no-CRO group who died.

DiscussionOur decision tool with a web-based interface is practical as it uses readily existing recipient pretransplant variables and provides a personalized risk of developing CRO within 1 year of HT. The performance RF model did not significantly change with by censoring death in both robustness analyses.The variables selected in the RF model mostly align with previously described factors, including pretransplant renal function and need for renal replacement treatment, age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, functional status, ventricular assist device requirement, and pretransplant cardiac index.4Habib P.J.

Clinical judgment (thorough physical examination and history taking, medication review, trending renal function on multiple data points, renal imaging, urine analysis, renal biopsy findings if available, etc.) should play a more significant role when the RF model predicts a positive outcome owing to the high false-positive rate and low positive predictive value. This scenario is related to the inability to capture reversibility in certain features (such as postoperative improvement in renal perfusion and renal function), uncertainty around donor quality, and perioperative course.We also evaluated our RF model with an external cohort (an external validation), 353 patients who underwent SHKT between January 10, 2019, and September 30, 2020. Our predictive model classified 93% of SHKT patient into the positive class and 7% of SHKT patients into the negative class, which suggests that the clinical re-evaluation of 7% of patients for SHKT eligibility is necessary.Strengths of this study include large sample size and utilization of the RF method with a multidimensional dataset. Nevertheless, the limitations are as follows: (i) potential bias inherent to the observational study design owing to unmeasured patient characteristics; (ii) vulnerability to significant changes in heart donor allocation policies affecting center practice and patient characteristics; and (iii) not capturing uncertainties potentially introducing prolonged AKI resulting from donor characteristics and postoperative complications.In conclusion, the proposed web-based decision tool powered by an RF-based machine learning method is an objective and cross-validated tool for patient-level identification of CRO risk among at-risk HT candidates. Our decision tool with a web-based interface is practical as it uses readily existing recipient pretransplant variables and provides a personalized risk of developing CRO within 1 year of HT. The performance RF model did not significantly change with by censoring death in both robustness analyses. The variables selected in the RF model mostly align with previously described factors, including pretransplant renal function and need for renal replacement treatment, age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, functional status, ventricular assist device requirement, and pretransplant cardiac index.4Habib P.J.

Clinical judgment (thorough physical examination and history taking, medication review, trending renal function on multiple data points, renal imaging, urine analysis, renal biopsy findings if available, etc.) should play a more significant role when the RF model predicts a positive outcome owing to the high false-positive rate and low positive predictive value. This scenario is related to the inability to capture reversibility in certain features (such as postoperative improvement in renal perfusion and renal function), uncertainty around donor quality, and perioperative course. We also evaluated our RF model with an external cohort (an external validation), 353 patients who underwent SHKT between January 10, 2019, and September 30, 2020. Our predictive model classified 93% of SHKT patient into the positive class and 7% of SHKT patients into the negative class, which suggests that the clinical re-evaluation of 7% of patients for SHKT eligibility is necessary. Strengths of this study include large sample size and utilization of the RF method with a multidimensional dataset. Nevertheless, the limitations are as follows: (i) potential bias inherent to the observational study design owing to unmeasured patient characteristics; (ii) vulnerability to significant changes in heart donor allocation policies affecting center practice and patient characteristics; and (iii) not capturing uncertainties potentially introducing prolonged AKI resulting from donor characteristics and postoperative complications. In conclusion, the proposed web-based decision tool powered by an RF-based machine learning method is an objective and cross-validated tool for patient-level identification of CRO risk among at-risk HT candidates.

Current epidemiological studies provide convincing evidence linking environmental arsenic exposure to an elevated risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). High levels of arsenic leaching from natural underground sources have contaminated newly drilled wells, leading to cancers of the skin, lung, liver, kidney, and bladder. This link has been the basis for regulatory actions. In 2002, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lowered the maximum contaminant level for the amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water from 50 ppb to 10 ppb (10 µ/L). In addition, recent molecular biology research on familial kidney cancer syndromes indicate that inactivation mutation in VHL tumor suppressor gene contributes to clear cell RCC development.

Living kidney donors (LKDs) experience a reduction in glomerular filtration rate of 25 to 30 mL/min after donor nephrectomy. Little is known about the effect of glomerular filtration rate decline on insulin sensitivity in LKDs. We conducted a prospective pilot study on 9 LKDs (N = 9) who underwent dynamic metabolic testing (mixed meal tolerance test) to measure proxies of insulin sensitivity (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, the area under curve [AUC] for insulin/glucose ratio, and Matsuda insulin sensitivity index) before and 3 months after donor nephrectomy. The primary outcome was the change in insulin sensitivity indices (delta [post-nephrectomy – pre-nephrectomy]). Four of the donors had a body mass index (BMI) between 32.0 and 36.7 predonation. Post–donor nephrectomy, compared with prenephrectomy values, median insulin AUC increased from 60.7 to 101.7 hr*mU/mL (delta median 33.3, P = .04) without significant change in median glucose AUC levels from 228.9 to 209.3 hr*mg/dL (delta median 3.2, P = .77). There was an increase in the median homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance from 2 to 2.9 (delta median 0.8, P = .03) and the AUC insulin/glucose ratio from 30.9 to 62.1 pmol/mmol (delta median 17.5, P = .001), whereas the median Matsuda insulin sensitivity index decreased from 5.9 to 2.9 (delta median −2, P = .05). The changes were more pronounced in obese (BMI >32) donors. LKDs appear to have a trend toward a decline in insulin sensitivity post–donor nephrectomy in the short term, especially in obese donors (BMI >32). Further investigation with a larger sample size and longer follow-up is needed.","2021-07-01","Transplantation Proceedings","https://openalex.org/S146061289","Elsevier BV","0041-1345","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.06.007",NA,NA,NA,"1858","1864","53","6",FALSE,2,2021,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3180447763","https://openalex.org/W3180447763,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.06.007,3180447763,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34246476,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/8384711","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.06.007","article","https://openalex.org/W1985359885,https://openalex.org/W2008905653,https://openalex.org/W2023961601,https://openalex.org/W2030795765,https://openalex.org/W2033667814,https://openalex.org/W2036812212,https://openalex.org/W2038310942,https://openalex.org/W2057355781,https://openalex.org/W2061925681,https://openalex.org/W2062356908,https://openalex.org/W2086040782,https://openalex.org/W2102092408,https://openalex.org/W2104169421,https://openalex.org/W2106111056,https://openalex.org/W2115427222,https://openalex.org/W2116990096,https://openalex.org/W2118174270,https://openalex.org/W2133795831,https://openalex.org/W2141363931,https://openalex.org/W2145486738,https://openalex.org/W2160234571,https://openalex.org/W2161215613,https://openalex.org/W2170378756,https://openalex.org/W2607031541,https://openalex.org/W2726763447,https://openalex.org/W2739262366,https://openalex.org/W2884901818,https://openalex.org/W2888302362,https://openalex.org/W2923172861,https://openalex.org/W2997513023","https://openalex.org/W138803513,https://openalex.org/W1986132654,https://openalex.org/W2010140898,https://openalex.org/W2010484394,https://openalex.org/W2032225465,https://openalex.org/W2056849036,https://openalex.org/W2082140668,https://openalex.org/W2151350502,https://openalex.org/W2410789767,https://openalex.org/W4234612679"

We study the problem of organ wastage in a queueing-theoretic framework. We establish that self-interested individuals set their utilization levels more conservatively in equilibrium than the socially efficient level. To reduce the resulting gap, we offer an incentive mechanism that recompenses candidates returning to the waitlist for retransplantation, who have accepted a predefined set of organs, for giving up their position in the waitlist and show that it increases the equilibrium utilization of organs while also improving social welfare. Furthermore, the degree of improvement increases monotonically with the level of this nonmonetary compensation provided by the mechanism. In practice, this mechanism can be implemented by preserving some fraction of the waiting time previously accumulated by returning candidates. A detailed numerical study for the U.S. renal transplant system suggests that such an incentive helps significantly reduce the kidney discard rate (baseline: 17.4%). Depending on the strength of the population’s response to the mechanism, the discard rate can be as low as 6.2% (strong response), 12.4% (moderate response), or 15.1% (weak response), which translates to 1,630, 724, or 338 more transplants per year, respectively. Although the average quality of transplanted kidneys deteriorates slightly, the resulting graft survival one-year posttransplant remains stable around 94.8% versus 95.0% for the baseline. We find that the optimal Kidney Donor Profile Index score cutoff, defining the set of incentivized kidneys, is around 85%, which coincides with the generally accepted definition of marginal kidneys in the medical community.

Pre-donation genetic testing is recommended in evaluation guidelines and regulatory policy. Collaborating across several institutions, we describe cases to illustrate the utility as well as practical issues in incorporating genetic testing in transplant protocols. Case 1 is from 2009, before pervasive genetic testing. A healthy 27-year-old Caucasian male had an uneventful donor evaluation for his mother, who had early onset ESKD of unclear cause. He participated in paired-exchange kidney donation, but developed progressive kidney disease and gout over the next 10 years. A uromodulin gene mutation (NM_003361.3(UMOD):c.377 G>A p.C126Y) was detected and kidney biopsy showed tubulointerstitial kidney disease. The patient subsequently required kidney transplantation himself. Case 2 was a 36-year-old African American female who had an uneventful kidney donor evaluation. She underwent gene panel-based testing to rule out ApolipoproteinL1 risk variants, for which was negative. Incidentally, a sickle-cell trait (NM_000518.5(HBB):c.20A>T p.Glu7Val) was noted, and she was declined for kidney donation. This led to significant patient anguish. Case 3 was a 26-year-old Caucasian female who underwent panel-based testing because the potential recipient, her cousin, carried a variant of uncertain significance in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-β (HNF1B) gene. While the potential donor did not harbor this variant, she was found to have a likely pathogenic variant in complement factor I (NM_000204.4(CFI):c.1311dup:p.Asp438Argfs*8), precluding kidney donation. Our cases emphasize that while genetic testing can be invaluable in donor evaluation, transplant centers should utilize detailed informed consent, develop care pathways for secondary genetic findings, and share experience to develop best practices around genetic testing in donors.","2022-03-26","Genes","https://openalex.org/S194631498","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","2073-4425","https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13040592","https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/13/4/592/pdf?version=1648290764","cc-by","publishedVersion","592","592","13","4",TRUE,2,2022,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4220987486","https://openalex.org/W4220987486,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13040592,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35456398","https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13040592","article","https://openalex.org/W2008905653,https://openalex.org/W2122084492,https://openalex.org/W2141198361,https://openalex.org/W2145486738,https://openalex.org/W2491645136,https://openalex.org/W2549008944,https://openalex.org/W2554756829,https://openalex.org/W2592492263,https://openalex.org/W2608361503,https://openalex.org/W2738954518,https://openalex.org/W2739262366,https://openalex.org/W2739896399,https://openalex.org/W2765338127,https://openalex.org/W2790740078,https://openalex.org/W2803799714,https://openalex.org/W2906428833,https://openalex.org/W2914651337,https://openalex.org/W2946258293,https://openalex.org/W2969734688,https://openalex.org/W3011686543,https://openalex.org/W3015680166,https://openalex.org/W3020743169,https://openalex.org/W3033767525,https://openalex.org/W3041995830,https://openalex.org/W3153542830,https://openalex.org/W3167506259","https://openalex.org/W1973714972,https://openalex.org/W1990329229,https://openalex.org/W2088078594,https://openalex.org/W2114046963,https://openalex.org/W2372524402,https://openalex.org/W2378019284,https://openalex.org/W2382568077,https://openalex.org/W3030709858,https://openalex.org/W3126449372,https://openalex.org/W4220987486"

As in all medical fields (3), transplantation is not immune to avoidable mishaps, which have indeed led directly to organs being rendered unusable (4). Additionally, the process of allocating less than ideal organs can indeed be painfully slow—so slow, in fact, that viable organs sometimes go unused due to the combined risk of elevated cold ischemia time (a common offer refusal reason) (5) and whatever factors led to the organ being deemed less than ideal in the first place (6,7). However, the predominant drivers of the nearly 25% kidney discard rate are not mishaps or poor technology. Rather, the US transplant system suffers from an organ offer refusal problem; far too many offers of imperfect but transplant-quality kidneys are refused on behalf of (or directly by) patients, prolonging the time it takes to find a clinically suitable “home” (patient) at a transplant center willing to take on the risk. In fact, the mean match run sequence number among accepted kidneys was recently estimated at 665, indicating that it is not atypical for hundreds—even thousands—of offers to be refused prior to finally securing an acceptance (8). After a kidney has a firm acceptance, the discard rate is only about 5% (8,9), indicating that approximately 80% of the discard problem is attributable to the inability to find an acceptor; a minority of discards occur postacceptance after an unexpected incident, such as a positive crossmatch, transportation delay, etc. The most common kidney discard reason reported by organ procurement organizations (OPOs) is, in fact, “no recipient located—list exhausted” (8,10,11), suggesting that OPOs attempted in vain to find an acceptor among all possible candidates. In an era of organ scarcity, where even the lowest-quality kidneys have been shown to confer a survival (and likely, quality of life) benefit over dialysis for many patients (12–14), how can it be that transplant decision making seems to reflect an era of plenty? Three Fundamental Realities Recent critics of the US transplant system seemingly fail to appreciate three fundamental realities of kidney transplantation relevant to the organ utilization challenge. (1) Not all donated kidneys are created alike. (2) The kidney allocation system is still largely tethered to the “first come, first served” fairness principle. (3) Major changes to organ allocation policy do not come easy. Critical comments about the US kidney discard rate seem to imply that the pool of available kidneys resembles a homogenous, fungible commodity, glossing over the fact that vast clinical differences exist among kidneys offered for transplant. Evaluating a deceased donor organ offer in many ways parallels shopping for a used car. A 20-year-old Civic with 175,000 miles on it might be perfectly adequate for “point A to B” travel for a few years, but clearly, it is not in the same league as a near-mint Lexus with under 10,000 miles coming off a short-term lease. Analogously, deceased donor kidneys vary substantially along a quality spectrum that portends highly differential expected graft longevity depending on donor age, medical history, etc. The decision to accept any particular kidney for any specific patient involves consideration of two key risks—graft failure and disease transmission (15)—along with tremendous uncertainty in how things will turn out for any given case (16,17), and it may very well be the most complex decision in all of medicine (18). A third critical dimension driving the complexity of the kidney acceptance decision is the very real possibility that another “better” kidney will soon be offered to the patient (19–21). If so, the right decision may indeed be to decline. Despite being substantially overhauled in 2014 (22), the “first come, first served” principle—a hallmark of fairness in the United States—is still largely entrenched into the kidney allocation system. Although arguably “fair,” the by-product is that the transplant candidates who tend to be the first ones offered less than ideal kidneys are also among the first to receive offers for much higher-quality kidneys due to having accrued substantial qualified waiting (or dialysis) time. This aspect of the system induces a disincentive to accept imperfect kidneys for the candidates at the top of the match run. These early refusals slow down the placement process, leading to a cascade of further refusals as the cold ischemia clock keeps ticking (23), and the combination of the organ being “too old” and “too cold” requires a boldness that not even the most risk-tolerant transplant program is willing to take. Ways to Improve the System There is certainly room for improvement in the operational parameters and DonorNet system features that govern the mechanics of the organ offering process, most notably in the manner and timing in which offers are distributed and responded to (24). For example, the inefficient use of the “provisional yes” response has been a long-recognized pain point in the organ placement process (25). Encouragingly, the entire paradigm for sending and responding to offers is now being re-examined by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), with guidance from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Operations & Safety Committee (26). Additionally, UNOS has recently implemented or begun piloting a number of sophisticated and potentially impactful DonorNet system enhancements: allowing users to see the complete donor record and respond to offers on a mobile device (27), allowing programs to avoid receiving unwanted offers by establishing multicriteria donor filters (28,29), and displaying novel predictive analytics (e.g., “time to next offer”) to combat decision complexity (30). Still, the effect of operational and system features designed to foster faster progression down the match list has limited the potential to address the discard problem if the allocation system still results in first-offered candidates having a built-in disincentive to accept less than ideal kidneys. One of UNOS’s stated aspirational goals is that no matter where on the quality spectrum an organ lies, the first person offered the organ should be the right one to accept it in terms of medical suitability, fairness, and the decision calculus surrounding the risks and benefits of accepting versus waiting for another. However, the current system built on a foundation emphasizing equity—not placement efficiency or maximizing organ utilization—is antithetical to that aspired reality. So how do we go from here—a system with built-in disincentives to accept offers—to there—a system that is still equitable but also “tuned for acceptance?” Kidney allocation policy should be modified in two key ways: by (1) changing the way waiting/dialysis time is used to prioritize patients and (2) codifying expedited placement pathways to aid OPOs in finding homes for hard to place kidneys. In some European countries’ implementation of the Senior Program, in which older-donor kidneys are preferentially offered to older candidates, senior patients are required to choose one list—the older (age 65+) donor kidney list or the all other kidneys list—from which to receive offers; they cannot remain on both (31,32). The choice is clear—wait longer for a higher-quality organ or get transplanted more quickly with a shorter-longevity kidney. The Extended Criteria Donor and high Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) programs were implemented in the United States such that candidates who choose to receive these offers also remain on the list for ideal-quality organs, weakening any incentive to accept the former given the very real possibility of receiving the latter. Reducing patients’ options by segmenting the allocation system and forcing a choice between a shorter wait for a shorter longevity kidney and vice versa is not the only (or necessarily best) way to tune the decision-making calculus toward acceptance. Altering how waiting time is used to prioritize patients across the donor quality (e.g., KDPI) spectrum, according to a paradigm coined as “dealing from the bottom of the deck” (33,34), may be a more effective approach to consider as OPTN migrates to the continuous distribution framework (35,36). If a patient just added to the list with little or no waiting time priority for the best kidneys was given first dibs on a higher KDPI kidney, the incentive equation may change in a way that fosters securing offer acceptance earlier in the placement process (37). Given the drastic differences in kidney utilization practices among kidney programs (38), OPTN is implementing a new monitoring framework designed to exert upward pressure on and reduce variability in offer acceptance rates (39). Because the long-standing hyperfocus on early post-transplant success rates has contributed to risk aversion, “balancing the scorecard” in a way that calls out overly selective acceptance practices may help nudge the system toward transplanting more organs. However, because significant program to program variation is likely to persist, codifying into the kidney allocation policy a center-targeted expedited placement pathway may have even greater potential to reduce avoidable discards (40,41). Currently, to salvage an organ at high risk of discard, OPOs are permitted to deviate from the prescribed patient order and expedite placement to centers with a track record of accepting similar organs, bypassing higher-priority candidates at other centers. However, this practice is not standardized and varies widely, and thus, it is likely suboptimal in terms of utilization and may be inequitable in terms of organ distribution (42). Codifying an expedited placement system, as recommended by a National Kidney Foundation panel (43), into the kidney allocation system would include a predetermined, evidence-driven set of triggers that identify scenarios with an unusually high probability of discard under the standard (sequential) allocation approach (44). Determining the right parameters for an effective expedited placement allocation system may not be easy (45,46) but could have a significant effect if well engineered. Practical Challenges to Realizing Change Are such ideas—prioritizing just-listed patients ahead those with years on dialysis and bypassing more medically or ethically justified patients to expedite placement to patients at another center—fair, equitable, and legally permissible? Although these strategies would only be applied to a subset of donated organs, would such bold changes be perceived by patients and the broader transplant community as “unfair,” potentially risking the foundation of trust that holds up the entire system? The OPTN Final Rule requires allocation policies to be equitable. However, a viable kidney that is discarded benefits no one. The transplant community may need to sacrifice some degree of geographic equity—where patients listed at the most aggressive programs will receive transplants faster than patients listed elsewhere—in order to have a meaningful effect on utility, recognizing that more transplants indirectly benefit all patients in need as a rising tide lifts all boats (47). The organ allocation policy development process in the United States is intentionally deliberative, involving numerous stakeholders, committee evidence gathering, formal public comment periods, and ultimately, Board of Directors’ approval and implementation. OPTN aims to achieve broad consensus in developing and implementing new, often highly complex policies as expeditiously as possible, a colossal and underappreciated balancing act made all of the more challenging due to vested interests resistant to change (48). Achieving an acceptable balance between equity, utility, and efficiency has taken years (49,50)—a reality that should be recognized by critics who may assume the existence of an “easy button” for quickly improving such a complex system. Concluding Thoughts Individuals and institutions responsible for preventable errors should be held accountable to drive down the rate of mishaps. The logistics of organ transportation, for example, remain an area ripe for process improvement and technologic innovation (51–53). The OPTN Operations & Safety and Disease Advisory Committees should continue to embrace their mission and study transplant errors (4), disseminate process improvement successes to the community (54,55), and propose new policies as needed (56–58). Donor-derived disease transmissions attributable to the limitations of testing (i.e., “window period” infections) should be distinguished from avoidable transmissions caused by testing or communication errors (55,59). The risk of contracting a donor-derived infection should be recognized to be extremely low (approximately 0.18%) (60), far lower than the risks associated with remaining on dialysis (61,62). Also, OPOs should be held accountable to high standards through better metrics and tangible consequences of underperformance to ensure that significant opportunities for donation and transplantation are not being missed (63–65). Although the juxtaposition of “wasted organs” and “system errors” makes for a good headline, despite the system’s flaws, the number of kidney transplants has increased 37% over the past 6 years from 18,597 in 2015 to a record 25,490 in 2021. The transplant community and its critics should recognize that the roots of the unacceptably high 20%–25% discard rate in the United States run deeper than the soundbites might suggest. Only after the true nature of the kidney discard problem (decision-making complexity) and the challenges in overcoming it (revising an allocation system still largely anchored in the deeply ingrained American ethic of “no cutting in line!”) are fully appreciated will the transplant community be in a position to thoughtfully develop and enact truly impactful solutions. OPTN should not migrate kidney policy to the continuous distribution framework without incorporating bold policy changes that squarely address the kidney discard problem. Disclosures G.

This retrospective cohort study reports a data analysis in Banner Healthcare System (a large not-for-profit organization) between 4/5/2022 and 8/1/2022 and included 19,778 Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) positive (by PCR or direct antigen testing) patients who were selected from Cerner-Electronic Health Record after the exclusions criteria were met. The study index date for cohort was determined as the date of BEB MAb administration or the date of the first positive COVID-19 testing. The cohort consist of COVID-19 infected patients who received BEB MAb (N = 1,091) compared to propensity score (PS) matched control (N = 1,091). The primary composite outcome was the incidence of 30-day all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality. All statistical analyses were conducted on the paired (matched) dataset. For the primary composite outcome, the event counts and percentages were reported. Ninety-five percent Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for percentages were computed. The study cohorts were 1:1 propensity matched without replacement across 26 covariates using an optimal matching algorithm that minimizes the sum of absolute pairwise distance across the matched sample after fitting and using logistic regression as the distance function. The pairs were matched exactly on patient vaccination status, BMI group, age group and diabetes status. Compared to the PS matched control group (2.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%, 3.7%), BEB MAb use (2.2%; 95% CI: 1.4%, 3.3%) did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary outcome (p = 0.67). In the subgroup analysis, we observed similar no-difference trends regarding the primary outcomes for the propensity rematched BEB MAb treated and untreated groups, stratified by patient vaccination status, age (<65 years or ≥65), and immunocompromised status (patients with HIV/AIDS or solid organ transplants or malignancy including lymphoproliferative disorder). The number needed to treat (1/0.026-0.022) with BEB MAb was 250 to avoid one hospitalization and/or death over 30 days. The BEB MAb use lacked efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants (mainly BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.5) in the Banner Healthcare System in the Southwestern United States.","2023-04-28","PLOS ONE","https://openalex.org/S202381698","Public Library of Science","1932-6203","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279326","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279326&type=printable","cc-by","publishedVersion","e0279326","e0279326","18","4",TRUE,2,2023,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4367309455","https://openalex.org/W4367309455,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279326,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37115780","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279326","article","https://openalex.org/W2036193982,https://openalex.org/W2122771444,https://openalex.org/W3008028633,https://openalex.org/W3034312608,https://openalex.org/W3090928025,https://openalex.org/W4220729480,https://openalex.org/W4220774106,https://openalex.org/W4220886953,https://openalex.org/W4220970752,https://openalex.org/W4225263923,https://openalex.org/W4225647476,https://openalex.org/W4226342921,https://openalex.org/W4282835288,https://openalex.org/W4283026725,https://openalex.org/W4285727819,https://openalex.org/W4286009139,https://openalex.org/W4295899573,https://openalex.org/W4296702018,https://openalex.org/W4298086777,https://openalex.org/W4298394671,https://openalex.org/W4304117179,https://openalex.org/W4310576518,https://openalex.org/W4312019047","https://openalex.org/W1987872986,https://openalex.org/W2129866949,https://openalex.org/W2240094448,https://openalex.org/W2557595673,https://openalex.org/W2980864243,https://openalex.org/W3173653403,https://openalex.org/W3211023268,https://openalex.org/W4213445964,https://openalex.org/W4220870952,https://openalex.org/W4282920017"

There has been speculation that the changes lower the threshold for diagnosing AAMR, and may lead to possible unnecessary and expensive treatment.We compared the 2013 Banff classification for AAMR to the previous 2007 Banff to determine if there was an increase in the number of patients receiving a diagnosis of AAMR and if the diagnosis affected allograft survival and post-biopsy 3-month and 6-month creatinine and eGFR values.A total of 212 renal allograft biopsies were compared to both 2007 and 2013 Banff classification requirements for AAMR. Ten patients (11 biopsies) met the 2007 criteria. An additional 15 patients (20 biopsies) met the 2013 criteria. These 2 groups showed no statistically significant demographic differences. By applying the 2013 Banff classification, we observed a 2.5-fold increase in the number of AAMR cases. One-year post-transplant allograft survival was higher in the 2013 group (.85 vs .55) and the 3-month and 6-month post-biopsy creatinine values were significantly lower for the 2013 group (1.6 ± .6 vs 3.3 ± 2.2, P value .01, and 1.7 ± .6 vs 3.4 ± 2.8, P value .03). The 3-month and 6-month eGFR values were higher in the 2013 group, although not statistically significant.These results suggest that use of Banff 2013 criteria in place of Banff 2007 may result in diagnosing milder and earlier cases of AAMR with the possibility of initiating earlier treatment and improving graft outcomes.","2019-07-01","Transplantation Proceedings","https://openalex.org/S146061289","Elsevier BV","0041-1345","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2019.04.060",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,1,2019,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2960978403","https://openalex.org/W2960978403,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2019.04.060,2960978403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31301854","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2019.04.060","article","https://openalex.org/W1500787381,https://openalex.org/W1526559676,https://openalex.org/W1556101114,https://openalex.org/W1577828678,https://openalex.org/W1737600104,https://openalex.org/W1985367183,https://openalex.org/W1986434123,https://openalex.org/W2016066312,https://openalex.org/W2016280339,https://openalex.org/W2038717608,https://openalex.org/W2056308199,https://openalex.org/W2071591630,https://openalex.org/W2098773501,https://openalex.org/W2122930177,https://openalex.org/W2125611223,https://openalex.org/W2173761316,https://openalex.org/W2320177594","https://openalex.org/W2003938723,https://openalex.org/W2010840551,https://openalex.org/W2019517015,https://openalex.org/W2118496982,https://openalex.org/W2364998975,https://openalex.org/W2439875401,https://openalex.org/W2519357708,https://openalex.org/W2525756941,https://openalex.org/W3186320617,https://openalex.org/W4238867864"

We studied 5344 SLKTs between May 1, 2007, and December 31, 2019, by using Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network registry data supplemented with United Network for Organ Sharing-DonorNet data. Designating a donor as having AKI required by definition that the following criteria were met: (1) the donor's condition aligned with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) international consensus guidelines and the terminal serum creatinine (Scr) level was ≥1.5 times the minimum Scr level for deceased donors before organ recovery and (2) the terminal Scr level was ≥1.5 mg/dL (a clinically meaningful and intuitive Scr threshold for defining AKI for transplant providers). The primary outcomes were liver transplant all-cause graft failure (ACGF; defined as graft failures and deaths) and kidney transplant death-censored graft failure (DCGF) at 1 year after transplant. The donors with AKI were young, had good organ quality, and had a short cold ischemia time. In the study cohort, 4482 donors had no AKI, whereas 862 had AKI (KDIGO AKI stages: 1, n = 521; 2, n = 202; and 3, n = 138). In the group with AKI and the group with no AKI, respectively, liver ACGF at 1 year (11.1% versus 12.9% [P = 0.13]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.49) and kidney DCGF at 1 year (4.6% versus 5.7% [P = 0.18]; HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.95-1.70) did not differ in the full multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.

The pandemic's effects on rural patients' overall care experience, attitudes to telemedicine, and vaccination are poorly understood.We administered a cross-sectional survey to adult kidney transplant recipients in central Pennsylvania across four clinical sites between March 29, 2021 and June 2, 2021. We assessed the pandemic's impact on care access, telemedicine experience, attitudes toward preventive measures, vaccination, and variation by sociodemographic variables.Survey completion rate was 51% (303/594). Of these, 52.8% were rural residents. The most common impact was use of telemedicine (79.2%). Predominant barriers to telemedicine were lack of video devices (10.9%), perceived complexity (5.6%), and technical issues (5.3%). On a 0-10 Likert scale, the mean positive impression for telemedicine was 7.7; lower for patients with telephone-only versus video visits (7.0 vs. 8.2; p < .001), and age ≥60 years (7.4 vs. 8.1; p = .01) on univariate analyses. Time/travel savings were commonly identified (115/241, 47.7%) best parts of telemedicine and lack of personal connection (70/166, 42.2%) the worst. Only 68.9% had received any dose of COVID vaccination. The vaccinated group members were older (58.4 vs. 53.5 years; p = .007), and less likely rural (47.8% vs. 65.2%; p = .005). Common themes associated with vaccine hesitancy included concerns about safety (27/59, 46%), perceived lack of data (19/59, 32%), and distrust (17/59, 29%). At least one misconception about the vaccines or COVID-19 was quoted by 29% of vaccine-hesitant patients.Among respondents, the pandemic significantly impacted healthcare experience, especially in older patients in underserved communities. COVID-19 vaccination rate was relatively low, driven by misconceptions and lack of trust.","2022-09-28","Transplant Infectious Disease","https://openalex.org/S14534568","Wiley-Blackwell","1398-2273","https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13943",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"24","6",FALSE,1,2022,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4297456972","https://openalex.org/W4297456972,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13943,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36169231","https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13943","article","https://openalex.org/W3012310845,https://openalex.org/W3012748253,https://openalex.org/W3015568800,https://openalex.org/W3028120330,https://openalex.org/W3035321364,https://openalex.org/W3036641899,https://openalex.org/W3038583962,https://openalex.org/W3081553985,https://openalex.org/W3084346572,https://openalex.org/W3093974194,https://openalex.org/W3094461804,https://openalex.org/W3114602681,https://openalex.org/W3121983294,https://openalex.org/W3124839873,https://openalex.org/W3135389761,https://openalex.org/W3135723690,https://openalex.org/W3139810373,https://openalex.org/W3142856359,https://openalex.org/W3143060041,https://openalex.org/W3156631411,https://openalex.org/W3164162028,https://openalex.org/W3169729075,https://openalex.org/W3171056757,https://openalex.org/W3176897911,https://openalex.org/W3196279698,https://openalex.org/W3199436439,https://openalex.org/W3209922541,https://openalex.org/W4200472298,https://openalex.org/W4200581412","https://openalex.org/W3015857697,https://openalex.org/W3041424928,https://openalex.org/W3120008685,https://openalex.org/W3127760827,https://openalex.org/W3139265257,https://openalex.org/W3152786669,https://openalex.org/W3165445564,https://openalex.org/W3183833107,https://openalex.org/W3198354525,https://openalex.org/W4226337653"

Willingness to accept kidneys from HCV-infected donors and timing/duration of DAA therapy have been evolving. Recent findings By 2021, most of the HCV NAT+ kidneys (92.6%) were transplanted to HCV-naive recipients. Despite the availability of effective DAA therapy, the discard rate of HCV NAT kidneys has been stagnant around 25%. The proportion of wait-listed patients willing to accept a deceased donor kidney from HCV Ab+ and HCV NAT+ donors increased 20-fold between 2015 and 2022. Wait-listed time to receive HCV NAT+ kidneys has been rising and most of the kidneys are transplanted to HCV-naive recipients. The proportion of deceased donor kidney transplants performed in recipients with HCV seropositivity decreased from 5.1 to 2.8% during the same period. Relatively short courses of DAA therapy (7–8 days) appear to be effective to decrease HCV transmission (<5%) and achieve sustained virological response at 12 weeks if administered prior to revascularization. Summary Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes of HCV NAT D+/R− transplantation and the best course of DAA treatment.","2022-10-13","Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S66851268","Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","1087-2418","https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000001031",NA,NA,NA,"22","28","28","1",FALSE,1,2022,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4305073007","https://openalex.org/W4305073007,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000001031,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36227758","https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000001031","article","https://openalex.org/W2609473168,https://openalex.org/W2780991151,https://openalex.org/W2789565767,https://openalex.org/W2789847666,https://openalex.org/W2886130990,https://openalex.org/W2890778396,https://openalex.org/W2899150089,https://openalex.org/W2913735700,https://openalex.org/W2969453070,https://openalex.org/W2972981094,https://openalex.org/W2981704170,https://openalex.org/W2985709543,https://openalex.org/W3015315374,https://openalex.org/W3022138940,https://openalex.org/W3080638426,https://openalex.org/W3082913599,https://openalex.org/W3084366479,https://openalex.org/W3096358159,https://openalex.org/W3112441664,https://openalex.org/W3120637367,https://openalex.org/W3175810474,https://openalex.org/W3200308161,https://openalex.org/W3202177721,https://openalex.org/W3210147575,https://openalex.org/W3216330596,https://openalex.org/W4206517362,https://openalex.org/W4281981756,https://openalex.org/W4282940421","https://openalex.org/W1966600384,https://openalex.org/W1983101136,https://openalex.org/W2357112927,https://openalex.org/W2366788526,https://openalex.org/W2884805679,https://openalex.org/W2906321212,https://openalex.org/W2907216614,https://openalex.org/W2921462009,https://openalex.org/W4305073007,https://openalex.org/W4309367136"

In an inpatient setting with heightened acuity of illness, the potential for bleeding attributable to anticoagulant is concerning. Hospitals have started applying an anticoagulant free HD protocol with success. COVID-19 patients showed a degree of systemic hypercoagulability with unique features, including a consumptive disseminated intravascular coagulation coexisting with hyperfibrinolysis and increased bleeding risk. Maintaining circuit patency and avoiding bleeding risk has been challenging. Data regarding anticoagulant in COVID-19 patients who received hemodialysis is limited. This study's primary objective is to compare hemodialysis clotting rate in COVID-19 patients who received anticoagulant versus those without anticoagulant. Methods: Retrospective chart review for all COVID-19 patients who received hemodialysis at Banner Medical Center Tucson Campus Between November 2020 and January 2021. Primary outcome was clotting rate during hemodialysis. CRRT was excluded. Results: 330 total patients observed, 56% sessions in the ICU unit and 44% in the medicine unit. 57% were AKI and 43% were ESRD. Anticoagulant use was 38.5% (heparin IVP during hemodialysis was 12%, continuous systemic heparin was 16% and others (warfarin, DOAC, Argatroban, etc) was 11%). Clotting rate was 12%. Other characteristics can be seen on the table 1. There was no difference in the clotting rate between group with anticoagulant versus without anticoagulant (8% vs.15%, p value 0.06). Multivariable logistic regression for clotting outcome showed that compared to no-anticoagulation, systemic heparin continuous infusion decreased clotting by 83% (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.77, p-value=0.02) and others anticoagulant decreased clotting by 91% (OR=0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.85);compared to AV fistula, temporary dialysis catheter increased clotting by 2.9x (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.10-7.44, p-value=0.03);and every 10 increase in platelet count increased clotting by 4% (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p value =0.01) Conclusions: No anticoagulation and temporary catheters carry high risk for clotting in patients with COVID undergoing iHD. Continuous heparin should be considered.","2021-01-01","Journal of The American Society of Nephrology","https://openalex.org/S115693375","American Society of Nephrology","1046-6673","https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-1489427",NA,NA,NA,"105","106","32",NA,FALSE,0,2021,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3210135220","https://openalex.org/W3210135220,3210135220",NA,"article","NA","https://openalex.org/W147166911,https://openalex.org/W1978546375,https://openalex.org/W2140396249,https://openalex.org/W2336723822,https://openalex.org/W2391790549,https://openalex.org/W2392878467,https://openalex.org/W2417140713,https://openalex.org/W2420717362,https://openalex.org/W2728086945,https://openalex.org/W2908148044,https://openalex.org/W3021103151,https://openalex.org/W3029429046,https://openalex.org/W3031193361,https://openalex.org/W3032676903,https://openalex.org/W3113408549,https://openalex.org/W3116599815,https://openalex.org/W3125649666,https://openalex.org/W3153714060,https://openalex.org/W3157615057,https://openalex.org/W3203854864"

In the absence of a reliable laboratory measure of immunosuppression burden (an “immunostat”), clinicians depend upon noninvasive measurements of traditional laboratory biomarkers and allograft biopsies to guide immunosuppression dosage and regimen. An important premise for seeking new non invasive monitoring tools is that long-term graft injury is driven by subclinical events undetected by traditional methods, such as a trend in serum creatinine levels. Studies have reported an incidence of up to 20% to 30% subclinical rejection in seemingly clinically stable patients.1 The last few years have seen an explosion in research focusing on the use of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) as the preeminent biomarker for the real-time detection of posttransplant rejection.2 A meta-analyses of all published studies showed that, at a fractional threshold of ≥1%, sensitivity for the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) was excellent, although it was less so for T-cell mediated rejection (mostly elevated at ≥1% threshold in Banff 1B or higher rejections).3 The major studies utilizing commercially available dd-cfDNA assays reported the following test performance characteristics for all rejections (using the 0.69%–1% cutoff to define test positivity): an area under the curve of 0.71 to 0.85, the sensitivity of 45% to 89%, specificity of 69% to 85%, positive predictive value of 52% to 77%, and a negative predictive value of 66% to 95% depending on the pretest probability of rejection.4 Most of these previous studies were performed in the context of ad hoc testing in patients with a presumed high pretest probability for rejection. The study by Huang et al5 assesses the predictive value of an initial single dd-cfDNA measurement in patients (between 1-m and 4-y posttransplant) with the absence of current or previous renal dysfunction, rejection episodes, and donor-specific antibody (DSA). The authors divided patients into 3 groups based upon dd-cfDNA: (a) high (N = 35/317; >1%); (b) moderate (N = 43/317; 0.5%–1%); and (c) low (239/317; <0.5%) dd-cfDNA. Allograft biopsies were performed on an average of 2 mo after dd-cfDNA measurement and were based on clinician preference rather than any set criteria (76% “for-cause” and 24% based on a moderate/high dd-cfDNA). Among the 62 (20%) patients biopsied, 24 were diagnosed with rejection. Those with high (6/25; 17%) or moderate (5/43; 12%) dd-cfDNA were more likely to have rejection than those with low (13/239; 5%) dd-cfDNA. Despite the lack of biopsies in the remainder of the patients, the authors report that there was no difference in short-term graft outcomes (median follow-up: 1.6 y) as measured via trends in kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) and de novo DSA formation. They conclude that most patients with elevated dd-cfDNA in conjunction with preserved allograft function remained stable over follow-up without deterioration in function (as measured by eGFR) or graft loss. Strengths of this study included large sample size, a well-known research group, and a “real-world scenario” with inherent complexities that clinicians need to navigate to provide care to kidney transplant patients. There are several weaknesses that need to be highlighted, though. The study population is too heterogeneous to derive any definitive conclusions from. There are several other instances of selection bias. This is suggested by the inclusion of patients all the way from 1 mo to 4 y from transplant. The authors suggest that tests were sent for routine surveillance, but the scenarios where a clinician taking care of a patient more than a year posttransplant with preserved graft function and no DSA would send dd-cfDNA are not clear. Allograft biopsies were done for varied reasons in only a small minority of patients and on an average 2-mo postreporting of dd-cfDNA result. What immunosuppressive adjustments were performed in the interim? In the absence of these data, the interpretation that there was no impact of dd-cfDNA measurements on 1-y graft outcomes is overly simplistic. The possibility of a type II error (false-negative outcome) due to inadequate follow-up also needs to be considered. A recently published large multicenter study that included nearly 1100 kidney transplant patients demonstrated a higher risk of loss of eGFR over 3 y and de novo DSA formation over time among kidney transplant patients with dd-cfDNA >0.5%.6 In our single-center study on the calibration of dd-cfDNA with traditional histopathology and molecular tissue gene expression (MMDx, Alberta, CA), sensitized patients at high risk for rejection (preformed or de novo DSA, and/or positive flow crossmatch at transplant, and/or documented medication nonadherence) were found to have a strong correlation with dd-cfDNA >1% and subclinical AMR diagnosed by MMDx but not by histopathology.7 Similar findings were confirmed by the multicenter Trifecta study.8 This study also reported that nearly half of the AMR cases were DSA negative. Other data using tissue gene expression have shown that many DSA positive but histologic and MMDx negative AMR cases do have upregulation of rejection transcripts.9 In addition, the Banff criteria for the diagnosis of T-cell mediated rejection and AMR continue to evolve.10 Finally, it is important to realize the possibility of significant interobserver variation in transplant biopsy interpretation by pathologists. These data indicate the complexity of calibrating noninvasive biomarkers to a flawed gold standard that is a moving target. Notwithstanding the above criticisms, the study by Huang et al is important in that it provides initial data on the uncertain value of routine cross-sectional dd-cfDNA testing for patients with a low pretest probability of rejection. Two ongoing prospective studies (The Ongoing Kidney Allograft Outcomes Registry [KOAR], NCT03984747, and The Prospera Kidney Transplant ACTIVE Rejection Assessment Registry [PROACTIVE], NCT03984747) aim to assess the impact of serial dd-cfDNA surveillance in kidney transplant recipients. Until these data become available, it seems reasonable to use clinical context and personalization of care when considering the utilization of dd-cfDNA surveillance in patients with preserved allograft function at a presumed minimal risk of rejection.","2022-08-01","Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S11564597","Wolters Kluwer","0041-1337","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004268",NA,NA,"publishedVersion","25","26","107","1",TRUE,0,2022,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4289334207","https://openalex.org/W4289334207,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004268,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35913058","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004268","article","https://openalex.org/W2808825376,https://openalex.org/W2856664011,https://openalex.org/W3083304631,https://openalex.org/W3129156014,https://openalex.org/W3180882971,https://openalex.org/W3193696325,https://openalex.org/W4200346616,https://openalex.org/W4220889435,https://openalex.org/W4225816508,https://openalex.org/W4289335921","https://openalex.org/W1511302864,https://openalex.org/W1569816628,https://openalex.org/W1862437987,https://openalex.org/W2021983387,https://openalex.org/W2043560509,https://openalex.org/W2087086071,https://openalex.org/W2352307153,https://openalex.org/W2589824098,https://openalex.org/W3178016388,https://openalex.org/W4206271106"

Even after procurement, 28% organs were discarded. For kidney transplants, the most common reason for high-quality organ discards (35%) was “exhaustion of waitlist,” indicating provider and patient reluctance to accept these transplants.1 Concerns for a presumed risk of donor transmission are supported by observations that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in plasma of up to 50%–100% hospitalized patients.2 Jansen has reported that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the human kidney.3 In a prospective ongoing Institutional Review Board approved study, transplant recipients that received SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive deceased donor kidneys were enrolled. Salient inclusion criteria for eligible candidates were (a) COVID vaccination with ≥2 primary vaccine series; (b) willingness to accept COVID-related prophylaxis and therapy as indicated; and (c) no active COVID-19 infection or other pneumonias. A total of 26 kidney transplants (23: Virginia Commonwealth University; 3: University of Utah) were performed from 24 donors between November 2021 and April 2022. Donor and recipient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Most of these kidney transplants originated from “hard to place” donors (“match sequence number>100” = 22 kidneys; median = 1348). Collation with US Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) registry showed that a significant proportion of other organs from these donors were either not procured or transplanted (no pancreata, no lungs, 14 [58%] livers, 21 [87%] hearts, and 10 [19%] kidneys). Among 42 transplanted kidneys [62% (26 of 42) performed at our centers], no graft loss or death had been reported with a median follow-up of 5.2 (IQR: 4.6–5.8) mo. Similarly, no graft loss or death was reported for 10 liver transplants and 3 heart transplants nationally.

Respiratory swab SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold count (Ct) was available only for 12 donors. Twenty-four donor plasma/serum (frozen at –70◦C till analyzed) and 26 preimplantation kidney biopsy tissue samples (stored in RNALater till analyzed) were assessed for detection of SARS-CoV-2 via a commercial quantitative RT-PCR (Eurofins-Viracor; lower limit of detection = 73 copies/mL) assay and found to be negative for detectable virus, including those from 10 (42%) donors with symptomatic disease. Although, none of our 26 enrolled recipients had a positive plasma or nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at 7 d posttransplant drawn per protocol, 3 patients (all from presumably asymptomatic donors) were diagnosed with clinical disease at 10-, 14-, and 23-d posttransplant. These were diagnosed during the fourth pandemic surge (December 2021–March 2022) with the patient diagnosed at 10th-d posttransplant having a confirmed sick contact. Although we were unable to obtain donor samples for genomic sequencing, no transmission was reported from other solid organ recipients of these donors. In this dual-center preliminary report, in a series of 26 donor kidneys, we report an absence of detectable donor viremia as well as virus in donor kidney tissue. It is unlikely, that the observed SARS-CoV-2 infection in our 3 (of 26; 11%) recipients represents donor transmission as symptomatic infection was seen outside the presumed incubation period of virus (~5.6 d)4 and lack of donor viremia/donor virus in tissue, recipient viremia, and respiratory virus immediately after transplant. In contrast to previous studies, where as only donors with incidental SARS-CoV-2 NAT tests were included,5 41% had symptomatic disease (Ct available only for 4 with symptomatic disease). Similar to other US data recently presented by OPTN Ad Hoc Disease Transmission Advisory Committee, most of our kidneys were accepted at high match sequence numbers indicating that they were “difficult to place.” Nevertheless, there are some limitations to our study. Our data cannot be applied to donors who may have higher respiratory viral loads. Also, ideally serial plasma testing immediately posttransplant would be required to confirm lack of donor viral transmission.

This retrospective cohort study reports a data analysis in Banner Healthcare System (a large not-for-profit organization) between 4/5/2022 and 8/1/2022 and included 19,778 Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) positive (by PCR or direct antigen testing) patients who were selected from Cerner-Electronic Health Record after the exclusions criteria were met. The study index date for cohort was determined as the date of BEB MAb administration or the date of the first positive COVID-19 testing. The cohort consist of COVID-19 infected patients who received BEB MAb (N=1,091) compared to propensity score (PS) matched control (N=1,091). The primary outcome was the incidence of 30-day all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality. All statistical analyses were conducted on the paired (matched) dataset. For the primary outcome, the event counts and percentages were reported. Ninety-five percent Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for percentages were computed. The study cohorts were 1:1 propensity matched without replacement across 26 covariates using an optimal matching algorithm that minimizes the sum of absolute pairwise distance across the matched sample after fitting and using logistic regression as the distance function. The pairs were matched exactly on patient vaccination status, BMI group, age group and diabetes status. Compared to the PS matched control group (2.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%, 3.7%), BEB MAb use (2.2%; 95% CI: 1.4%, 3.3%) did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary outcome (p=0.67). In the subgroup analysis, we observed similar no-difference trends regarding the primary outcomes for the propensity rematched BEB MAb treated and untreated groups, stratified by patient vaccination status, age (&lt;65 years or ≥65), and immunocompromised status (patients with HIV/AIDS or solid organ transplants or malignancy including lymphoproliferative disorder). The number needed to treat (1/0.026-0.022) with BEB MAb was 250 to avoid one hospitalization and/or death over 30 days. The BEB MAb use lacked efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants (mainly BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.5) in the Banner Healthcare System in the Southwestern United States.","2022-12-07","medRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)","https://openalex.org/S4306400573","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.06.22283183",NA,"cc-by","submittedVersion",NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,0,2022,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4311814760","https://openalex.org/W4311814760,https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.06.22283183","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.06.22283183","article","https://openalex.org/W4220774106,https://openalex.org/W4220886953,https://openalex.org/W4220970752,https://openalex.org/W4225647476,https://openalex.org/W4283026725,https://openalex.org/W4286009139,https://openalex.org/W4295899573,https://openalex.org/W4296211388,https://openalex.org/W4296702018,https://openalex.org/W4298086777,https://openalex.org/W4298394671,https://openalex.org/W4310576518","https://openalex.org/W1987872986,https://openalex.org/W2129866949,https://openalex.org/W2240094448,https://openalex.org/W2557595673,https://openalex.org/W3173653403,https://openalex.org/W3211023268,https://openalex.org/W4213445964,https://openalex.org/W4220870952,https://openalex.org/W4282920017,https://openalex.org/W4312100727"

METHODS This study reports a retrospective data analysis in Banner Health Care System. Out of 109,788 adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19, the study cohort was split into patients who received Casirivimab-Imdevimab (Cas-Imd) (N=10,836; Delta-predominant period 6/2021-11/2021) and Sotrovimab (N=998; Omicron-predominant period 12/2021-1/2022) mAb compared to propensity-matched control groups (N=10,836 and N=998), respectively. Index date was the date of mAb administration or the date of positive COVID-19 testing. The primary and secondary outcomes were the incidence of composite outcome (all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality) and ICU admission at 30-days following index date, respectively. RESULTS Compared to the propensity-matched untreated control cohort, the Cas-Imd mAb reduced the composite outcome (from 7.5% to 3.7%; difference: -3.8% [95% CI: (-4.4%, -3.2%)], p &lt;0.01) regardless of their vaccination status, while Sotrovimab mAb did not (5.0% vs. 3.8%; difference: -1.2% [95% CI: (-3.1%, 0.7%)], p =0.22). In terms of the secondary outcome, similarly Cas-Imd mAb decreased ICU admission during the first hospitalization (from 1.5% to 0.5%; difference: -1.0% [95% CI: (-1.3%, -0.7%)], p &lt;0.01) compared to the control group, whereas Sotrovimab mAb did not (0.9% vs. 0.6%; difference: -0.3% [95% CI: (-1.2%, 0.6%)], p =0.61). Comparing the periods, the Omicron-predominant period was associated with lower composite outcome than that during the Delta-predominant period. CONCLUSIONS Cas-Imd mAb was effective against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, however sotrovimab lacked efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-predominant period.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved 100 MAbs between 1986 and 2021, and MAbs account for 20% of Food and Drug Administration’s new drug approval every year. MAbs are preferred over traditional immunosuppressive agents because of their high specificity, reduced number of drug-drug interactions, and low toxicity, which make them a prime example of personalized medicine. In this review article, we provide an overview of the taxonomy, pharmacology, and therapeutic applications of MAbs in glomerular diseases. We searched the literature through PubMed using the following search terms: monoclonal antibodies, glomerular diseases, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunoglobulin, murine, chimeric, humanized, and fully human, and limited our search to years 2018-2023. We selected peer-reviewed journal articles with an evidence-based approach, prioritizing randomized control trials in specific glomerular diseases, if available. Advances in the MAb field have resulted in a significant paradigm shift in targeted treatment of immune-mediated glomerular diseases, and multiple randomized control trials are currently being conducted. Increased recognition is critical to expand their use in experimental research and personalized medicine.","2023-08-01","Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Innovations, Quality & Outcomes","https://openalex.org/S2898327595","Elsevier BV","2542-4548","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2023.04.009","http://www.mcpiqojournal.org/article/S2542454823000255/pdf","cc-by-nc-nd","publishedVersion","276","290","7","4",TRUE,0,2023,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4382864201","https://openalex.org/W4382864201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2023.04.009,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37448529","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2023.04.009","article","https://openalex.org/W340921193,https://openalex.org/W1940810331,https://openalex.org/W1989273660,https://openalex.org/W1993590923,https://openalex.org/W2019828059,https://openalex.org/W2051157535,https://openalex.org/W2051978504,https://openalex.org/W2052862354,https://openalex.org/W2056744071,https://openalex.org/W2063340779,https://openalex.org/W2063661691,https://openalex.org/W2081641593,https://openalex.org/W2084056567,https://openalex.org/W2090669047,https://openalex.org/W2091057822,https://openalex.org/W2092704043,https://openalex.org/W2094621560,https://openalex.org/W2095671546,https://openalex.org/W2096534302,https://openalex.org/W2116975025,https://openalex.org/W2119812267,https://openalex.org/W2124838654,https://openalex.org/W2130929166,https://openalex.org/W2131457901,https://openalex.org/W2132820210,https://openalex.org/W2133736867,https://openalex.org/W2136149088,https://openalex.org/W2157296439,https://openalex.org/W2162452494,https://openalex.org/W2166822765,https://openalex.org/W2167795729,https://openalex.org/W2171990964,https://openalex.org/W2298285162,https://openalex.org/W2305176160,https://openalex.org/W2463452932,https://openalex.org/W2470335436,https://openalex.org/W2532400747,https://openalex.org/W2557141247,https://openalex.org/W2564284206,https://openalex.org/W2570318764,https://openalex.org/W2604135869,https://openalex.org/W2614646425,https://openalex.org/W2671512643,https://openalex.org/W2741564119,https://openalex.org/W2748410878,https://openalex.org/W2762025355,https://openalex.org/W2767295340,https://openalex.org/W2769997286,https://openalex.org/W2788177282,https://openalex.org/W2804956348,https://openalex.org/W2809202750,https://openalex.org/W2809282407,https://openalex.org/W2883863660,https://openalex.org/W2902739495,https://openalex.org/W2910737538,https://openalex.org/W2914604561,https://openalex.org/W2940093782,https://openalex.org/W2953848769,https://openalex.org/W2959402094,https://openalex.org/W2960130441,https://openalex.org/W2968392782,https://openalex.org/W2969665548,https://openalex.org/W2970803602,https://openalex.org/W2971940586,https://openalex.org/W2987675420,https://openalex.org/W2995755986,https://openalex.org/W3006355409,https://openalex.org/W3009429865,https://openalex.org/W3014011850,https://openalex.org/W3015889552,https://openalex.org/W3023315053,https://openalex.org/W3037338668,https://openalex.org/W3041689857,https://openalex.org/W3047551100,https://openalex.org/W3076329354,https://openalex.org/W3080098141,https://openalex.org/W3085025551,https://openalex.org/W3088090215,https://openalex.org/W3094954267,https://openalex.org/W3118525048,https://openalex.org/W3118979249,https://openalex.org/W3121454410,https://openalex.org/W3133606094,https://openalex.org/W3135175735,https://openalex.org/W3136121359,https://openalex.org/W3157953061,https://openalex.org/W3164137010,https://openalex.org/W3167169072,https://openalex.org/W3199695429,https://openalex.org/W3200553460,https://openalex.org/W3202510981,https://openalex.org/W4213062994,https://openalex.org/W4281899143,https://openalex.org/W4285093641,https://openalex.org/W4294300890,https://openalex.org/W4297184089,https://openalex.org/W4299961269,https://openalex.org/W4307203260,https://openalex.org/W4309714133,https://openalex.org/W4309859591,https://openalex.org/W4311138749,https://openalex.org/W4311317998","https://openalex.org/W79555446,https://openalex.org/W188266097,https://openalex.org/W1969876219,https://openalex.org/W1978032370,https://openalex.org/W1990964652,https://openalex.org/W2049819497,https://openalex.org/W2071747460,https://openalex.org/W2400461952,https://openalex.org/W3024440267,https://openalex.org/W4205993769"

Utilizing DonorNet attachments from 4,480 expanded criteria donors (ECD) recovered between 2008 and 2012 in the United States with at least one kidney biopsied and transplanted, we analyzed the relationship between kidney length and vascular plaques and 10-year hazard of all-cause graft failure (ACGF) using causal inference methods in a Cox regression framework. The composite plaque score (range 0-4) and the presence of any plaque (yes, no) was also analyzed. Kidney length was modeled both categorically (<10, 10-12, >12 cm) as well as numerically, using a restricted cubic spline to capture nonlinearity. Effects of a novel composite plaque score 4 vs. 0 (HR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.23) and the presence of any vascular plaque (HR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.20) were attenuated after adjustment. Likewise, we identified a potential nonlinear relationship between kidney length and the 10-year hazard of ACGF, however the strength of the relationship was attenuated after adjusting for other donor factors. The independent effects of vascular plaque and kidney length on long-term ECD graft survival were found to be minimal and should not play a significant role in utilization.","2023-07-14","Transplant International","https://openalex.org/S121647140","Springer Science+Business Media","0934-0874","https://doi.org/10.3389/ti.2023.11373","https://www.frontierspartnerships.org/articles/10.3389/ti.2023.11373/pdf","cc-by","publishedVersion",NA,NA,"36",NA,TRUE,0,2023,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4384298066","https://openalex.org/W4384298066,https://doi.org/10.3389/ti.2023.11373,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37519905","https://doi.org/10.3389/ti.2023.11373","article","https://openalex.org/W86128385,https://openalex.org/W1648231011,https://openalex.org/W1969627037,https://openalex.org/W1989234276,https://openalex.org/W2011430059,https://openalex.org/W2019477238,https://openalex.org/W2026913096,https://openalex.org/W2047391263,https://openalex.org/W2059769468,https://openalex.org/W2073290956,https://openalex.org/W2093274439,https://openalex.org/W2110818436,https://openalex.org/W2126049444,https://openalex.org/W2132324013,https://openalex.org/W2134843796,https://openalex.org/W2144387798,https://openalex.org/W2172847004,https://openalex.org/W2334840569,https://openalex.org/W2464822802,https://openalex.org/W2539251908,https://openalex.org/W2545458768,https://openalex.org/W2625241012,https://openalex.org/W2794409263,https://openalex.org/W2801495698,https://openalex.org/W2889553968,https://openalex.org/W2971864661,https://openalex.org/W3007351662,https://openalex.org/W3011104356,https://openalex.org/W3080473307,https://openalex.org/W4226434761,https://openalex.org/W4281616366,https://openalex.org/W4290723743","https://openalex.org/W1972357283,https://openalex.org/W1977555849,https://openalex.org/W2052004720,https://openalex.org/W2079077757,https://openalex.org/W2096709092,https://openalex.org/W2153826555,https://openalex.org/W2469284823,https://openalex.org/W2739658758,https://openalex.org/W3028727574,https://openalex.org/W4323662027"

Using optimal matching methods, we matched every recipient to three comparators receiving kidneys from SARS-CoV-2-negative deceased donors with otherwise highly similar characteristics within the same transplant centers to compare 6-month eGFR.Among recipients of SARS-CoV-2-infected donor kidneys, one recipient died with a functional graft within 6 months. Mean 6-month eGFR was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2-infected and non-infected donor groups (55±21 and 57±25 mL/min/1.73m2; p=0.61). Six-month eGFR in recipients from SARS-CoV-2-infected donors who died from reasons other than COVID-19 was not significantly different from those from SARS-CoV-2-negative donors (58±22 and 56±25 mL/min/1.73m2; p=0.51). However, recipients from donors who died from COVID-19 had significantly lower 6-month eGFR that those from SARS-CoV-2-negative donors (46±17 and 58±27 mL/min/1.73m2; p=0.03). No donor-to-recipient SARS-CoV-2 transmission was observed.Six-month eGFR was not significantly different between recipients of kidneys from SARS-CoV-2-infected and non-infected donors. However, those receiving kidneys from donors who died from COVID-19 had significantly lower 6-month eGFR. Donor-to-recipient SARS-CoV-2 transmission was not observed.","2023-08-14","Clinical Journal of The American Society of Nephrology","https://openalex.org/S184267533","American Society of Nephrology","1555-9041","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.0000000000000275",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,0,2023,"https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4385797901","https://openalex.org/W4385797901,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.0000000000000275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37574663","https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.0000000000000275","article","NA","https://openalex.org/W3127156785,https://openalex.org/W3176864053,https://openalex.org/W3198183218,https://openalex.org/W4205317059,https://openalex.org/W4205810683,https://openalex.org/W4206548596,https://openalex.org/W4206651655,https://openalex.org/W4206669628,https://openalex.org/W4224279380,https://openalex.org/W4281729957"
