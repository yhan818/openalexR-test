"https://openalex.org/W4220847717","Early Data on Utilization and Discard of Organs From COVID-19–infected Donors: A US National Registry Analysis","To the Editor: Expansion of the donor pool remains a major unmet need for solid organ transplants. Early data suggest that at least some severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test–positive (NAT+) organs could be transplanted safely although there is substantial controversy about this topic.1-5 In theory, respiratory viruses are less likely to carry risk of viremia and infection of abdominal organs, although no commercial test is currently available to assess SARS-CoV-2 viremia. In this retrospective analysis of the US Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database, we report the initial experience with SARS-CoV-2 NAT+ (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] NAT+) deceased donor organs, with a focus on kidney transplants, from August 8, 2020, to September 29, 2021. During this time period, 17 143 COVID-19 NAT-negative (NAT−) deceased donors and 150 COVID-19 NAT+ deceased donors were assessed for organ donation (Figure 1). When compared with COVID-19 NAT− donors, there was a higher (P < 0.001 for all) nonrecovery rate for COVID-19 NAT+ hearts (35% versus 87%), lungs (71% versus 99%), livers (24% versus 53%), and pancreas (89% versus 98%), although this was not the case for kidneys (4.5% versus 1.6%).FIGURE 1.: Relative proportional disposition of recovered organs between August 8, 2020, and September 29, 2021. COVID-19 NAT-negative (–) organs: N = 17 143; COVID-19 NAT-positive (+) organs: N = 150. COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; NAT, nucleic acid test.Of total 385 recovered organs from 150 COVID-19 NAT+ donors, 276 (72%) organs were transplanted into 262 recipients. Donor details for these 150 donors are reported in Table 1. There was an increasing trend toward organ recovery across 3 pandemic periods (July 22, 2020–December 2020 [13; 9%]; January 2021–June 2021 [56; 37%]; and July 2021–September 2021 [81; 54%]). Most donors had a last reported COVID-19 NAT+ ≤7 d before procurement (94; 62.7%; Table S1, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C375). Table S2 (SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C375) describes the utilization of all COVID-19 NAT+ organs. Although only a minority of pancreata, hearts, lungs, and livers were procured, they were almost all transplanted postprocurement. In contrast, there was a high discard rate for kidneys postprocurement (102/295; 34.6%) compared with COVID-19 NAT− kidneys (6767/32717; 20.6%). Presumably superior quality COVID-19 NAT+ kidneys were discarded (mean kidney donor profile index, 67% versus 76%; P = 0.04) with the most common reason (~70%) for discards being “exhaustion of the waitlist” (Table 1). The organ discard rate did not differ substantially based upon the time (≤7 d [27.6%] versus 8–28 d [26.7%] or ≥28 d [30.8%]) of positive COVID-19 NAT before donation.

Limited outcome data (Table S3, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C375) were available on 262 transplant recipients with median posttransplant follow-up of 75 d (range, 23–243 d). Three (of 180; 1.6%) kidney allograft losses were reported, of which, 2 were because of allograft thrombosis on the day of transplant. Five deaths (2 kidneys [1%]; 3 livers [5.6%]) were reported, of which, 1 was because of respiratory failure and 1 because of sepsis. Table S4 (SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C375) shows the characteristics of 180 “kidney-only” transplant recipients. Most patients received induction rabbit antithymocyte globulin (62.8%) followed by triple maintenance immunosuppression (tacrolimus/mycophenolate/steroids; ~67%–80%). Of the 149 patients of whom data were available, the average length of stay was relatively short (median = 4 d) with a delayed graft function rate of 24%. These data provide early reassuring evidence on the utilization of non–lung SARS-CoV-2 NAT+ solid organ transplants. Many of these donors were selected despite positive NAT ≤7 d before procurement and abnormal lung imaging. Despite this, a substantially lower procurement rate for non–kidney transplantable organs and a high discard rate for kidneys (driven primarily by absence of recipient availability) were noted. For “kidney-only” transplant patients, immunosuppression regimens were largely unaltered compared with the “standard-of-care.” These data are limited by the absence of detailed donor characteristics, for example, computer tomographic imaging of lungs, vaccination status of donors and recipients, use of pretransplant (donor) or posttransplant (recipient) COVID-19 therapies, and longer-term follow-up of recipients with the availability of transmission data. Finally, it is unclear as to how many COVID-19–positive potential donors were never approached for organ donation.","2022-03-01",2022,"Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S11564597","Wolters Kluwer","0041-1337","article","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004091","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004091",NA,NA,"106","5",TRUE,"bronze","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004091",NA,11,FALSE

Background Real-world data on the effectiveness of neutralizing casirivimab-imdevimab monoclonal antibody (Cas-Imd mAb) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among high-risk patients may inform the response to future SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods This study covers an observational retrospective data analysis in Banner Health Care System sites, mainly in Arizona. During the study period, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was between 95% and 100%. Of 29 635 patients who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 1 August 2021 and 30 October 2021, in the Banner Health Care System, the study cohort was split into 4213 adult patients who received Cas-Imd mAb (1200 mg) treatment compared to a PS-matched 4213 untreated patients. The primary outcomes were the incidence of all-cause hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality within 30 days of Cas-Imd mAb administration or Delta variant infection. Results Compared to the PS-matched untreated cohort, the Cas-Imd mAb cohort had significantly lower all-cause hospitalization (4.2% vs 17.6%; difference in percentages, −13.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, −14.7 to −12.0]; P &amp;lt; .001), ICU admission (0.3% vs 2.8%; difference, −2.4 [95% CI, −3.0 to −1.9]; P &amp;lt; .001), and mortality (0.2% vs 2.0%; difference, −1.8 [95% CI, −2.3 to −1.3]; P &amp;lt; .001) within 30 days. The Cas-Imd mAb treatment was associated with lower rate of hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22 [95% CI, .19–.26]; P &amp;lt; .001) and mortality (HR, 0.11 [95% CI, .06–.21]; P &amp;lt; .001). Conclusions Cas-Imd mAb treatment was associated with a lower hospitalization rate, ICU admission, and mortality within 30 days among patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.","2022-04-12",2022,"Open Forum Infectious Diseases","https://openalex.org/S2735126445","Oxford University Press","2328-8957","article","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac186","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac186","https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article-pdf/9/7/ofac186/45028855/ofac186.pdf","cc-by-nc-nd","9","7",TRUE,"gold","https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article-pdf/9/7/ofac186/45028855/ofac186.pdf",NA,8,FALSE

This has left a practice gap related to the management and follow-up of a population that is at an increased risk of comorbidities and potentially poor outcomes. For this reason, it is important to synthesize evidence from the current literature because this can help direct the movement for more robust studies to clarify best practice recommendations.We sought to create a narrative review for the practicing dermatologist when diagnosing and leading the care of IgA vasculitis in adult patients.A broad literature search was performed with a focus on articles that were published after the introduction of the most updated European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology/Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization/Pediatric Rheumatology European Society criteria.The characteristics and management guidelines for IgA vasculitis in adults have been refined, although more rigorous studies are needed to develop best practice recommendations.Because of the lack of sufficient randomized controlled trials on IgA vasculitis in adults, this narrative review is composed of mostly observational, descriptive studies.Adults with IgA vasculitis are at an increased risk of complicated disease course, necessitating formal diagnostic assessment and clear-cut follow-up recommendations to manage and prevent poor health outcomes related to various comorbidities.","2022-09-01",2022,"JAAD International","https://openalex.org/S4210208778","Elsevier BV","2666-3287","article","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdin.2022.05.004","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdin.2022.05.004",NA,"cc-by-nc-nd","8",NA,TRUE,"green","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdin.2022.05.004",NA,6,FALSE
"https://openalex.org/W4290723743","Increased Rates of Kidney Discard in the Era of COVID-19 and Recent KAS Policy Implementation","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted transplant activity negatively across the United States.1,2 The early phase of the pandemic witnessed decreased new waitlist additions and transplant rates and increased waitlist mortality and graft failure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) introduced a major change in the kidney allocation system (KAS) policy on March 15, 2021, removing Donation Service Area (DSA) and OPTN region, introducing circles of a radius 250 nautical miles around donor hospitals, and adding allocation proximity points (the KAS-250 policy). The OPTN 6-mo postimplementation report indicated that number of deceased donor kidney transplants increased, whereas waitlist mortality and discard rate both decreased.3 In this retrospective study, we evaluated kidney discard patterns over time and their associations with the COVID-19 pandemic and the KAS-250 policy changes using OPTN data from October 31, 2008, through March 31, 2022, divided into 4 eras: (i) pre-KAS era: October 31, 2008, to December 3, 2014; (ii) KAS era: December 4, 2014, to March 10, 2020; (iii) COVID-19 only era: March 11, 2020, to March 14, 2021, covering the first year of COVID-19 pandemic until the start of the KAS-250 policy; and (iv) KAS-250 era: March 15, 2021, to March 31, 2022, covering the first year of the KAS-250 policy implementation and overlaps with the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean monthly discard rate increased significantly across the 4 eras: from 18.47% to 19.66% to 21.81% to 24.78% (P < 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons, Tables S1–S2, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C544). Our trends analysis (Figure 1) revealed that discard rate remained stable around its respective mean values within the pre-KAS and KAS eras (similar to previously reported),4 but it started increasing, albeit slowly, in the COVID-19 only era (trend P value: 0.30), and the increase accelerated in the KAS-250 era (trend P value: 0.01), resulting in a peak rate of 28.34% in November 2021 followed by a downward trend concluding with 23.40% in March 2022. Discard rate, however, was not uniformly distributed across the United States (Figure 2). Although the 30% threshold was exceeded in only 1 DSA (within OPTN Region 2—Northeast), in each of the pre-KAS and KAS eras, it was exceeded in 5 DSAs (within OPTN Regions 3—Southeast,5—Northeast, and 9—West) in the COVID-19 only era and in 10 DSAs (within OPTN Regions 2—Northeast, 3—Southeast, 11—East, 5—West, 6—Northwest, and 10—Midwest) in the KAS-250 era.FIGURE 1.: Discard rate trends for deceased donor kidneys in the United States by donor recovery year and major events (kidney allocation policy changes and COVID-19 pandemic).

Discard rate is calculated for each OPO’s DSA in aggregate. State and county boundaries are indicated in thick and thin white colored lines, respectively. DSA, donation service area; KAS, kidney allocation system; OPO, organ procurement organization.Across the 4 eras, the proportion of kidneys recovered for transplantation with high Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI), namely, KDPI 35% to 85% and KDPI >85%, increased steadily from 47.82% and 13.18% in the pre-KAS era to 51.99% and 16.18%, respectively, in the KAS-250 era (Tables S1–S2, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C544). These trends coupled with rising discard rates for KDPI 35% to 85% and KDPI >85% kidneys (from 19.65% and 56.39% in the pre-KAS era to 23.93% and 66.48%, respectively, in the KAS-250 era) (Figure S1, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C544) mostly accounted for the overall increasing trend observed in the KAS-250 era (Figure 1). “No recipient located—list exhausted” has become an increasingly dominant reason for discards (20.53% in the pre-KAS versus 61.84% in the KAS-250 era) and surpassed abnormal biopsy findings by a factor of 4 in the KAS-250 era (14.50% versus 61.84%). Based on a propensity score (using inverse probability of treatment weighting) adjusted multivariable mixed effect logistic regression (accounting for the random effects of organ procurement organizations [OPOs]), the odds of discard, compared with the pre-KAS era (the control group), increased by 2% (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio: 0.95-1.09) during the KAS era, by 12% (CI: 1.03-1.22) during the COVID-19 only era, and by 24% (CI: 1.13-1.36) during the KAS-250 era (Table S3, SDC, https://links.lww.com/TP/C544). It is not easy to pin down a single reason for recent increase in discard rates. Potential explanations include (1) the enhanced strive of OPOs to expand the donor pool and to recover more (high KDPI) organs for transplant4,5,6; (2) COVID-19 pandemic-related strain on health care systems (eg, lack of hospital beds, COVID-19–infected providers and candidates, socioeconomical disruptions, insufficient staffing and machines in dialysis units)7,8,9,10,11; (3) increased risk averse behavior of transplant center during the COVID-19 pandemic2,6,12; (4) the impact of KAS-250 policy (difficulties in transporting organs, prolonged cold ischemia, lack of machine perfusion devices sharing between OPOs)13; (5) lack of efficient expedited placement of hard-to-place kidneys)14; and (6) the growing number of potential donors with COVID-19 infection and a lack of high-quality evidence to guide decisions regarding deceased donation.5 Knowing that “No recipient located—list exhausted” has become the major reason for discards in the KAS-250 era, elimination of logistic barriers, refining kidney allocation inefficiencies, and the OPTN’s close monitoring on transplant metrics will be critical in effective handling of discards.

"https://openalex.org/W4302011830","Oversimplification and Misplaced Blame Will Not Solve the Complex Kidney Underutilization Problem","Introduction The Washington Post article “70 deaths, many wasted organs are blamed on transplant system errors” (1) and the Senate hearings of August 3, 2022 (2) both gave the misleading impression that the organ discard problem is primarily attributable to transportation-related mistakes, other human or system errors, and outdated computer technology that slows down the organ allocation process. As in all medical fields (3), transplantation is not immune to avoidable mishaps, which have indeed led directly to organs being rendered unusable (4). Additionally, the process of allocating less than ideal organs can indeed be painfully slow—so slow, in fact, that viable organs sometimes go unused due to the combined risk of elevated cold ischemia time (a common offer refusal reason) (5) and whatever factors led to the organ being deemed less than ideal in the first place (6,7). However, the predominant drivers of the nearly 25% kidney discard rate are not mishaps or poor technology. Rather, the US transplant system suffers from an organ offer refusal problem; far too many offers of imperfect but transplant-quality kidneys are refused on behalf of (or directly by) patients, prolonging the time it takes to find a clinically suitable “home” (patient) at a transplant center willing to take on the risk. In fact, the mean match run sequence number among accepted kidneys was recently estimated at 665, indicating that it is not atypical for hundreds—even thousands—of offers to be refused prior to finally securing an acceptance (8). After a kidney has a firm acceptance, the discard rate is only about 5% (8,9), indicating that approximately 80% of the discard problem is attributable to the inability to find an acceptor; a minority of discards occur postacceptance after an unexpected incident, such as a positive crossmatch, transportation delay, etc. The most common kidney discard reason reported by organ procurement organizations (OPOs) is, in fact, “no recipient located—list exhausted” (8,10,11), suggesting that OPOs attempted in vain to find an acceptor among all possible candidates. In an era of organ scarcity, where even the lowest-quality kidneys have been shown to confer a survival (and likely, quality of life) benefit over dialysis for many patients (12–14), how can it be that transplant decision making seems to reflect an era of plenty? Three Fundamental Realities Recent critics of the US transplant system seemingly fail to appreciate three fundamental realities of kidney transplantation relevant to the organ utilization challenge. (1) Not all donated kidneys are created alike. (2) The kidney allocation system is still largely tethered to the “first come, first served” fairness principle. (3) Major changes to organ allocation policy do not come easy. Critical comments about the US kidney discard rate seem to imply that the pool of available kidneys resembles a homogenous, fungible commodity, glossing over the fact that vast clinical differences exist among kidneys offered for transplant. Evaluating a deceased donor organ offer in many ways parallels shopping for a used car. A 20-year-old Civic with 175,000 miles on it might be perfectly adequate for “point A to B” travel for a few years, but clearly, it is not in the same league as a near-mint Lexus with under 10,000 miles coming off a short-term lease. Analogously, deceased donor kidneys vary substantially along a quality spectrum that portends highly differential expected graft longevity depending on donor age, medical history, etc. The decision to accept any particular kidney for any specific patient involves consideration of two key risks—graft failure and disease transmission (15)—along with tremendous uncertainty in how things will turn out for any given case (16,17), and it may very well be the most complex decision in all of medicine (18). A third critical dimension driving the complexity of the kidney acceptance decision is the very real possibility that another “better” kidney will soon be offered to the patient (19–21). If so, the right decision may indeed be to decline. Despite being substantially overhauled in 2014 (22), the “first come, first served” principle—a hallmark of fairness in the United States—is still largely entrenched into the kidney allocation system. Although arguably “fair,” the by-product is that the transplant candidates who tend to be the first ones offered less than ideal kidneys are also among the first to receive offers for much higher-quality kidneys due to having accrued substantial qualified waiting (or dialysis) time. This aspect of the system induces a disincentive to accept imperfect kidneys for the candidates at the top of the match run. These early refusals slow down the placement process, leading to a cascade of further refusals as the cold ischemia clock keeps ticking (23), and the combination of the organ being “too old” and “too cold” requires a boldness that not even the most risk-tolerant transplant program is willing to take. Ways to Improve the System There is certainly room for improvement in the operational parameters and DonorNet system features that govern the mechanics of the organ offering process, most notably in the manner and timing in which offers are distributed and responded to (24). For example, the inefficient use of the “provisional yes” response has been a long-recognized pain point in the organ placement process (25). Encouragingly, the entire paradigm for sending and responding to offers is now being re-examined by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), with guidance from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Operations & Safety Committee (26). Additionally, UNOS has recently implemented or begun piloting a number of sophisticated and potentially impactful DonorNet system enhancements: allowing users to see the complete donor record and respond to offers on a mobile device (27), allowing programs to avoid receiving unwanted offers by establishing multicriteria donor filters (28,29), and displaying novel predictive analytics (e.g., “time to next offer”) to combat decision complexity (30). Still, the effect of operational and system features designed to foster faster progression down the match list has limited the potential to address the discard problem if the allocation system still results in first-offered candidates having a built-in disincentive to accept less than ideal kidneys. One of UNOS’s stated aspirational goals is that no matter where on the quality spectrum an organ lies, the first person offered the organ should be the right one to accept it in terms of medical suitability, fairness, and the decision calculus surrounding the risks and benefits of accepting versus waiting for another. However, the current system built on a foundation emphasizing equity—not placement efficiency or maximizing organ utilization—is antithetical to that aspired reality. So how do we go from here—a system with built-in disincentives to accept offers—to there—a system that is still equitable but also “tuned for acceptance?” Kidney allocation policy should be modified in two key ways: by (1) changing the way waiting/dialysis time is used to prioritize patients and (2) codifying expedited placement pathways to aid OPOs in finding homes for hard to place kidneys. In some European countries’ implementation of the Senior Program, in which older-donor kidneys are preferentially offered to older candidates, senior patients are required to choose one list—the older (age 65+) donor kidney list or the all other kidneys list—from which to receive offers; they cannot remain on both (31,32). The choice is clear—wait longer for a higher-quality organ or get transplanted more quickly with a shorter-longevity kidney. The Extended Criteria Donor and high Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) programs were implemented in the United States such that candidates who choose to receive these offers also remain on the list for ideal-quality organs, weakening any incentive to accept the former given the very real possibility of receiving the latter. Reducing patients’ options by segmenting the allocation system and forcing a choice between a shorter wait for a shorter longevity kidney and vice versa is not the only (or necessarily best) way to tune the decision-making calculus toward acceptance. Altering how waiting time is used to prioritize patients across the donor quality (e.g., KDPI) spectrum, according to a paradigm coined as “dealing from the bottom of the deck” (33,34), may be a more effective approach to consider as OPTN migrates to the continuous distribution framework (35,36). If a patient just added to the list with little or no waiting time priority for the best kidneys was given first dibs on a higher KDPI kidney, the incentive equation may change in a way that fosters securing offer acceptance earlier in the placement process (37). Given the drastic differences in kidney utilization practices among kidney programs (38), OPTN is implementing a new monitoring framework designed to exert upward pressure on and reduce variability in offer acceptance rates (39). Because the long-standing hyperfocus on early post-transplant success rates has contributed to risk aversion, “balancing the scorecard” in a way that calls out overly selective acceptance practices may help nudge the system toward transplanting more organs. However, because significant program to program variation is likely to persist, codifying into the kidney allocation policy a center-targeted expedited placement pathway may have even greater potential to reduce avoidable discards (40,41). Currently, to salvage an organ at high risk of discard, OPOs are permitted to deviate from the prescribed patient order and expedite placement to centers with a track record of accepting similar organs, bypassing higher-priority candidates at other centers. However, this practice is not standardized and varies widely, and thus, it is likely suboptimal in terms of utilization and may be inequitable in terms of organ distribution (42). Codifying an expedited placement system, as recommended by a National Kidney Foundation panel (43), into the kidney allocation system would include a predetermined, evidence-driven set of triggers that identify scenarios with an unusually high probability of discard under the standard (sequential) allocation approach (44). Determining the right parameters for an effective expedited placement allocation system may not be easy (45,46) but could have a significant effect if well engineered. Practical Challenges to Realizing Change Are such ideas—prioritizing just-listed patients ahead those with years on dialysis and bypassing more medically or ethically justified patients to expedite placement to patients at another center—fair, equitable, and legally permissible? Although these strategies would only be applied to a subset of donated organs, would such bold changes be perceived by patients and the broader transplant community as “unfair,” potentially risking the foundation of trust that holds up the entire system? The OPTN Final Rule requires allocation policies to be equitable. However, a viable kidney that is discarded benefits no one. The transplant community may need to sacrifice some degree of geographic equity—where patients listed at the most aggressive programs will receive transplants faster than patients listed elsewhere—in order to have a meaningful effect on utility, recognizing that more transplants indirectly benefit all patients in need as a rising tide lifts all boats (47). The organ allocation policy development process in the United States is intentionally deliberative, involving numerous stakeholders, committee evidence gathering, formal public comment periods, and ultimately, Board of Directors’ approval and implementation. OPTN aims to achieve broad consensus in developing and implementing new, often highly complex policies as expeditiously as possible, a colossal and underappreciated balancing act made all of the more challenging due to vested interests resistant to change (48). Achieving an acceptable balance between equity, utility, and efficiency has taken years (49,50)—a reality that should be recognized by critics who may assume the existence of an “easy button” for quickly improving such a complex system. Concluding Thoughts Individuals and institutions responsible for preventable errors should be held accountable to drive down the rate of mishaps. The logistics of organ transportation, for example, remain an area ripe for process improvement and technologic innovation (51–53). The OPTN Operations & Safety and Disease Advisory Committees should continue to embrace their mission and study transplant errors (4), disseminate process improvement successes to the community (54,55), and propose new policies as needed (56–58). Donor-derived disease transmissions attributable to the limitations of testing (i.e., “window period” infections) should be distinguished from avoidable transmissions caused by testing or communication errors (55,59). The risk of contracting a donor-derived infection should be recognized to be extremely low (approximately 0.18%) (60), far lower than the risks associated with remaining on dialysis (61,62). Also, OPOs should be held accountable to high standards through better metrics and tangible consequences of underperformance to ensure that significant opportunities for donation and transplantation are not being missed (63–65). Although the juxtaposition of “wasted organs” and “system errors” makes for a good headline, despite the system’s flaws, the number of kidney transplants has increased 37% over the past 6 years from 18,597 in 2015 to a record 25,490 in 2021. The transplant community and its critics should recognize that the roots of the unacceptably high 20%–25% discard rate in the United States run deeper than the soundbites might suggest. Only after the true nature of the kidney discard problem (decision-making complexity) and the challenges in overcoming it (revising an allocation system still largely anchored in the deeply ingrained American ethic of “no cutting in line!”) are fully appreciated will the transplant community be in a position to thoughtfully develop and enact truly impactful solutions. OPTN should not migrate kidney policy to the continuous distribution framework without incorporating bold policy changes that squarely address the kidney discard problem. Disclosures G.

"https://openalex.org/W4210971474","A Simple Incentive Mechanism to Alleviate the Burden of Organ Wastage in Transplantation","Despite efforts to increase the supply of donated organs for transplantation, organ shortages persist. We study the problem of organ wastage in a queueing-theoretic framework. We establish that self-interested individuals set their utilization levels more conservatively in equilibrium than the socially efficient level. To reduce the resulting gap, we offer an incentive mechanism that recompenses candidates returning to the waitlist for retransplantation, who have accepted a predefined set of organs, for giving up their position in the waitlist and show that it increases the equilibrium utilization of organs while also improving social welfare. Furthermore, the degree of improvement increases monotonically with the level of this nonmonetary compensation provided by the mechanism. In practice, this mechanism can be implemented by preserving some fraction of the waiting time previously accumulated by returning candidates. A detailed numerical study for the U.S. renal transplant system suggests that such an incentive helps significantly reduce the kidney discard rate (baseline: 17.4%). Depending on the strength of the population’s response to the mechanism, the discard rate can be as low as 6.2% (strong response), 12.4% (moderate response), or 15.1% (weak response), which translates to 1,630, 724, or 338 more transplants per year, respectively. Although the average quality of transplanted kidneys deteriorates slightly, the resulting graft survival one-year posttransplant remains stable around 94.8% versus 95.0% for the baseline. We find that the optimal Kidney Donor Profile Index score cutoff, defining the set of incentivized kidneys, is around 85%, which coincides with the generally accepted definition of marginal kidneys in the medical community.

Remaining patients with CKD with GFR of 45–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 may not be suitable for SHKT. Nevertheless, applying these criteria to HT alone recipients between 2000 and 2019, approximately 33% of them with an estimated GFR of 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 pretransplant (Supplementary Table S1), not considered as eligible for SHKT, may still be at risk of developing end-stage renal disease. Therefore, a personalized computer-aided model to predict the possibility of advanced kidney failure in early post-transplant period is needed to identify at-risk candidates.In this study, we developed a machine learning (random forest [RF])–based algorithm to predict composite renal outcomes (CRO defined as dependence on chronic dialysis, GFR <20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, or having received a kidney transplant) among adult HT recipients at risk (GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) at post-transplant 1 year.

At the fixed sensitivity of 80.0%, the model resulted in 46.2% specificity, 97.8% negative predictive value, and 8.1% positive predictive value. For the given negative predictive value performance, our RF model mislabeled 2.2% of cases (=100%–97.8%). On the basis of 2019 statistics, the absolute and relative reduction in risk prediction was 3.9% (=6.1%–2.2%) and 64% (=[6.1%–2.2% / 6.1%] × 100), respectively.Robustness of the ModelTo find the robustness of our model, we conducted 2 separate analyses. First, we trained the RF model using a data set that excluded patients who died in the no-CRO group; the model resulted in a C-statistic of 0.71 (95% CI 0.69–0.75). At the fixed sensitivity of 80.0%, the model had 46.3% specificity, 98.1% negative predictive value, and 8.0% positive predictive value. In the second analysis, we developed a RF survival model by treating the death event in the first year as a competing event to CRO occurrence and reported the accuracy of CRO prediction at 1 year. The competing event RF model classified CRO with 70.6% accuracy.Characteristics of the Patients Who DiedBecause post-transplant mortality is relevant to the analysis, we also described comparative characteristics of the patients who died in both groups within 1 year post-transplant (Supplementary Table S5). The post-HT patients with CRO who died were more likely to have diabetes and worse Karnofsky scores and require dialysis pretransplant than the patients in the no-CRO group who died.DiscussionOur decision tool with a web-based interface is practical as it uses readily existing recipient pretransplant variables and provides a personalized risk of developing CRO within 1 year of HT. The performance RF model did not significantly change with by censoring death in both robustness analyses.The variables selected in the RF model mostly align with previously described factors, including pretransplant renal function and need for renal replacement treatment, age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, functional status, ventricular assist device requirement, and pretransplant cardiac index.4Habib P.J.

Clinical judgment (thorough physical examination and history taking, medication review, trending renal function on multiple data points, renal imaging, urine analysis, renal biopsy findings if available, etc.) should play a more significant role when the RF model predicts a positive outcome owing to the high false-positive rate and low positive predictive value. This scenario is related to the inability to capture reversibility in certain features (such as postoperative improvement in renal perfusion and renal function), uncertainty around donor quality, and perioperative course.We also evaluated our RF model with an external cohort (an external validation), 353 patients who underwent SHKT between January 10, 2019, and September 30, 2020. Our predictive model classified 93% of SHKT patient into the positive class and 7% of SHKT patients into the negative class, which suggests that the clinical re-evaluation of 7% of patients for SHKT eligibility is necessary.Strengths of this study include large sample size and utilization of the RF method with a multidimensional dataset. Nevertheless, the limitations are as follows: (i) potential bias inherent to the observational study design owing to unmeasured patient characteristics; (ii) vulnerability to significant changes in heart donor allocation policies affecting center practice and patient characteristics; and (iii) not capturing uncertainties potentially introducing prolonged AKI resulting from donor characteristics and postoperative complications.In conclusion, the proposed web-based decision tool powered by an RF-based machine learning method is an objective and cross-validated tool for patient-level identification of CRO risk among at-risk HT candidates.DisclosureThe author, JLG, served as a consultant in the advisory board of Pfizer, Inc., Alnylam, Eidos Therapeutics, and Sarepta.

Designating a donor as having AKI required by definition that the following criteria were met: (1) the donor's condition aligned with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) international consensus guidelines and the terminal serum creatinine (Scr) level was ≥1.5 times the minimum Scr level for deceased donors before organ recovery and (2) the terminal Scr level was ≥1.5 mg/dL (a clinically meaningful and intuitive Scr threshold for defining AKI for transplant providers). The primary outcomes were liver transplant all-cause graft failure (ACGF; defined as graft failures and deaths) and kidney transplant death-censored graft failure (DCGF) at 1 year after transplant. The donors with AKI were young, had good organ quality, and had a short cold ischemia time. In the study cohort, 4482 donors had no AKI, whereas 862 had AKI (KDIGO AKI stages: 1, n = 521; 2, n = 202; and 3, n = 138). In the group with AKI and the group with no AKI, respectively, liver ACGF at 1 year (11.1% versus 12.9% [P = 0.13]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.49) and kidney DCGF at 1 year (4.6% versus 5.7% [P = 0.18]; HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.95-1.70) did not differ in the full multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Selected kidneys from deceased donors with AKI can be considered for SLKT.","2022-03-03",2022,"Liver Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S205547219","Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","1527-6465","article","https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.26406","https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.26406",NA,NA,"28","6",FALSE,"closed",NA,NA,2,FALSE

Pre-donation genetic testing is recommended in evaluation guidelines and regulatory policy. Collaborating across several institutions, we describe cases to illustrate the utility as well as practical issues in incorporating genetic testing in transplant protocols. Case 1 is from 2009, before pervasive genetic testing. A healthy 27-year-old Caucasian male had an uneventful donor evaluation for his mother, who had early onset ESKD of unclear cause. He participated in paired-exchange kidney donation, but developed progressive kidney disease and gout over the next 10 years. A uromodulin gene mutation (NM_003361.3(UMOD):c.377 G>A p.C126Y) was detected and kidney biopsy showed tubulointerstitial kidney disease. The patient subsequently required kidney transplantation himself. Case 2 was a 36-year-old African American female who had an uneventful kidney donor evaluation. She underwent gene panel-based testing to rule out ApolipoproteinL1 risk variants, for which was negative. Incidentally, a sickle-cell trait (NM_000518.5(HBB):c.20A>T p.Glu7Val) was noted, and she was declined for kidney donation. This led to significant patient anguish. Case 3 was a 26-year-old Caucasian female who underwent panel-based testing because the potential recipient, her cousin, carried a variant of uncertain significance in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-β (HNF1B) gene. While the potential donor did not harbor this variant, she was found to have a likely pathogenic variant in complement factor I (NM_000204.4(CFI):c.1311dup:p.Asp438Argfs*8), precluding kidney donation. Our cases emphasize that while genetic testing can be invaluable in donor evaluation, transplant centers should utilize detailed informed consent, develop care pathways for secondary genetic findings, and share experience to develop best practices around genetic testing in donors.","2022-03-26",2022,"Genes","https://openalex.org/S194631498","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","2073-4425","article","https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13040592","https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13040592","https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/13/4/592/pdf?version=1648290764","cc-by","13","4",TRUE,"gold","https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/13/4/592/pdf?version=1648290764",NA,2,FALSE
"https://openalex.org/W4307751836","Detection of Transmissible Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 From Deceased Kidney Donors: Implications for Kidney Transplant Recipients","We reported that in the United States, 388 organs from (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test (NAT) positive 150 donors were procured between August 2020 and September 2021.1 Considering that nearly 1 million deaths have been attributed to COVID pandemic, this suggests that a highly selected group of donor organs were assessed for transplantation. Even after procurement, 28% organs were discarded. For kidney transplants, the most common reason for high-quality organ discards (35%) was “exhaustion of waitlist,” indicating provider and patient reluctance to accept these transplants.1 Concerns for a presumed risk of donor transmission are supported by observations that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in plasma of up to 50%–100% hospitalized patients.2 Jansen has reported that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the human kidney.3 In a prospective ongoing Institutional Review Board approved study, transplant recipients that received SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive deceased donor kidneys were enrolled. Salient inclusion criteria for eligible candidates were (a) COVID vaccination with ≥2 primary vaccine series; (b) willingness to accept COVID-related prophylaxis and therapy as indicated; and (c) no active COVID-19 infection or other pneumonias. A total of 26 kidney transplants (23: Virginia Commonwealth University; 3: University of Utah) were performed from 24 donors between November 2021 and April 2022. Donor and recipient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Most of these kidney transplants originated from “hard to place” donors (“match sequence number>100” = 22 kidneys; median = 1348). Collation with US Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) registry showed that a significant proportion of other organs from these donors were either not procured or transplanted (no pancreata, no lungs, 14 [58%] livers, 21 [87%] hearts, and 10 [19%] kidneys). Among 42 transplanted kidneys [62% (26 of 42) performed at our centers], no graft loss or death had been reported with a median follow-up of 5.2 (IQR: 4.6–5.8) mo. Similarly, no graft loss or death was reported for 10 liver transplants and 3 heart transplants nationally.

Respiratory swab SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold count (Ct) was available only for 12 donors. Twenty-four donor plasma/serum (frozen at –70◦C till analyzed) and 26 preimplantation kidney biopsy tissue samples (stored in RNALater till analyzed) were assessed for detection of SARS-CoV-2 via a commercial quantitative RT-PCR (Eurofins-Viracor; lower limit of detection = 73 copies/mL) assay and found to be negative for detectable virus, including those from 10 (42%) donors with symptomatic disease. Although, none of our 26 enrolled recipients had a positive plasma or nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at 7 d posttransplant drawn per protocol, 3 patients (all from presumably asymptomatic donors) were diagnosed with clinical disease at 10-, 14-, and 23-d posttransplant. These were diagnosed during the fourth pandemic surge (December 2021–March 2022) with the patient diagnosed at 10th-d posttransplant having a confirmed sick contact. Although we were unable to obtain donor samples for genomic sequencing, no transmission was reported from other solid organ recipients of these donors. In this dual-center preliminary report, in a series of 26 donor kidneys, we report an absence of detectable donor viremia as well as virus in donor kidney tissue. It is unlikely, that the observed SARS-CoV-2 infection in our 3 (of 26; 11%) recipients represents donor transmission as symptomatic infection was seen outside the presumed incubation period of virus (~5.6 d)4 and lack of donor viremia/donor virus in tissue, recipient viremia, and respiratory virus immediately after transplant. In contrast to previous studies, where as only donors with incidental SARS-CoV-2 NAT tests were included,5 41% had symptomatic disease (Ct available only for 4 with symptomatic disease). Similar to other US data recently presented by OPTN Ad Hoc Disease Transmission Advisory Committee, most of our kidneys were accepted at high match sequence numbers indicating that they were “difficult to place.” Nevertheless, there are some limitations to our study. Our data cannot be applied to donors who may have higher respiratory viral loads. Also, ideally serial plasma testing immediately posttransplant would be required to confirm lack of donor viral transmission.

The pandemic's effects on rural patients' overall care experience, attitudes to telemedicine, and vaccination are poorly understood.We administered a cross-sectional survey to adult kidney transplant recipients in central Pennsylvania across four clinical sites between March 29, 2021 and June 2, 2021. We assessed the pandemic's impact on care access, telemedicine experience, attitudes toward preventive measures, vaccination, and variation by sociodemographic variables.Survey completion rate was 51% (303/594). Of these, 52.8% were rural residents. The most common impact was use of telemedicine (79.2%). Predominant barriers to telemedicine were lack of video devices (10.9%), perceived complexity (5.6%), and technical issues (5.3%). On a 0-10 Likert scale, the mean positive impression for telemedicine was 7.7; lower for patients with telephone-only versus video visits (7.0 vs. 8.2; p < .001), and age ≥60 years (7.4 vs. 8.1; p = .01) on univariate analyses. Time/travel savings were commonly identified (115/241, 47.7%) best parts of telemedicine and lack of personal connection (70/166, 42.2%) the worst. Only 68.9% had received any dose of COVID vaccination. The vaccinated group members were older (58.4 vs. 53.5 years; p = .007), and less likely rural (47.8% vs. 65.2%; p = .005). Common themes associated with vaccine hesitancy included concerns about safety (27/59, 46%), perceived lack of data (19/59, 32%), and distrust (17/59, 29%). At least one misconception about the vaccines or COVID-19 was quoted by 29% of vaccine-hesitant patients.Among respondents, the pandemic significantly impacted healthcare experience, especially in older patients in underserved communities. COVID-19 vaccination rate was relatively low, driven by misconceptions and lack of trust.","2022-09-28",2022,"Transplant Infectious Disease","https://openalex.org/S14534568","Wiley-Blackwell","1398-2273","article","https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13943","https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13943",NA,NA,"24","6",FALSE,"green","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9539214",NA,1,FALSE

Willingness to accept kidneys from HCV-infected donors and timing/duration of DAA therapy have been evolving.By 2021, most of the HCV NAT+ kidneys (92.6%) were transplanted to HCV-naive recipients. Despite the availability of effective DAA therapy, the discard rate of HCV NAT kidneys has been stagnant around 25%. The proportion of wait-listed patients willing to accept a deceased donor kidney from HCV Ab+ and HCV NAT+ donors increased 20-fold between 2015 and 2022. Wait-listed time to receive HCV NAT+ kidneys has been rising and most of the kidneys are transplanted to HCV-naive recipients. The proportion of deceased donor kidney transplants performed in recipients with HCV seropositivity decreased from 5.1 to 2.8% during the same period. Relatively short courses of DAA therapy (7-8 days) appear to be effective to decrease HCV transmission (<5%) and achieve sustained virological response at 12 weeks if administered prior to revascularization.Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes of HCV NAT D+/R- transplantation and the best course of DAA treatment.","2022-10-13",2022,"Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S66851268","Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","1087-2418","article","https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000001031","https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000001031",NA,NA,"28","1",FALSE,"closed",NA,NA,1,FALSE

This retrospective cohort study reports a data analysis in Banner Healthcare System (a large not-for-profit organization) between 4/5/2022 and 8/1/2022 and included 19,778 Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) positive (by PCR or direct antigen testing) patients who were selected from Cerner-Electronic Health Record after the exclusions criteria were met. The study index date for cohort was determined as the date of BEB MAb administration or the date of the first positive COVID-19 testing. The cohort consist of COVID-19 infected patients who received BEB MAb (N=1,091) compared to propensity score (PS) matched control (N=1,091). The primary outcome was the incidence of 30-day all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality. All statistical analyses were conducted on the paired (matched) dataset. For the primary outcome, the event counts and percentages were reported. Ninety-five percent Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals for percentages were computed. The study cohorts were 1:1 propensity matched without replacement across 26 covariates using an optimal matching algorithm that minimizes the sum of absolute pairwise distance across the matched sample after fitting and using logistic regression as the distance function. The pairs were matched exactly on patient vaccination status, BMI group, age group and diabetes status. Compared to the PS matched control group (2.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7%, 3.7%), BEB MAb use (2.2%; 95% CI: 1.4%, 3.3%) did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary outcome (p=0.67). In the subgroup analysis, we observed similar no-difference trends regarding the primary outcomes for the propensity rematched BEB MAb treated and untreated groups, stratified by patient vaccination status, age (&lt;65 years or ≥65), and immunocompromised status (patients with HIV/AIDS or solid organ transplants or malignancy including lymphoproliferative disorder). The number needed to treat (1/0.026-0.022) with BEB MAb was 250 to avoid one hospitalization and/or death over 30 days.

"https://openalex.org/W4289334207","Donor-derived Cell-free DNA Measurement in Kidney Transplant Patients Without Allograft Dysfunction: More Evidence and More Questions","Finding the right balance between underimmunosuppression and overimmunosuppression remains one of the holy grails of kidney transplants. In the absence of a reliable laboratory measure of immunosuppression burden (an “immunostat”), clinicians depend upon noninvasive measurements of traditional laboratory biomarkers and allograft biopsies to guide immunosuppression dosage and regimen. An important premise for seeking new non invasive monitoring tools is that long-term graft injury is driven by subclinical events undetected by traditional methods, such as a trend in serum creatinine levels. Studies have reported an incidence of up to 20% to 30% subclinical rejection in seemingly clinically stable patients.1 The last few years have seen an explosion in research focusing on the use of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) as the preeminent biomarker for the real-time detection of posttransplant rejection.2 A meta-analyses of all published studies showed that, at a fractional threshold of ≥1%, sensitivity for the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) was excellent, although it was less so for T-cell mediated rejection (mostly elevated at ≥1% threshold in Banff 1B or higher rejections).3 The major studies utilizing commercially available dd-cfDNA assays reported the following test performance characteristics for all rejections (using the 0.69%–1% cutoff to define test positivity): an area under the curve of 0.71 to 0.85, the sensitivity of 45% to 89%, specificity of 69% to 85%, positive predictive value of 52% to 77%, and a negative predictive value of 66% to 95% depending on the pretest probability of rejection.4 Most of these previous studies were performed in the context of ad hoc testing in patients with a presumed high pretest probability for rejection. The study by Huang et al5 assesses the predictive value of an initial single dd-cfDNA measurement in patients (between 1-m and 4-y posttransplant) with the absence of current or previous renal dysfunction, rejection episodes, and donor-specific antibody (DSA). The authors divided patients into 3 groups based upon dd-cfDNA: (a) high (N = 35/317; >1%); (b) moderate (N = 43/317; 0.5%–1%); and (c) low (239/317; <0.5%) dd-cfDNA. Allograft biopsies were performed on an average of 2 mo after dd-cfDNA measurement and were based on clinician preference rather than any set criteria (76% “for-cause” and 24% based on a moderate/high dd-cfDNA). Among the 62 (20%) patients biopsied, 24 were diagnosed with rejection. Those with high (6/25; 17%) or moderate (5/43; 12%) dd-cfDNA were more likely to have rejection than those with low (13/239; 5%) dd-cfDNA. Despite the lack of biopsies in the remainder of the patients, the authors report that there was no difference in short-term graft outcomes (median follow-up: 1.6 y) as measured via trends in kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) and de novo DSA formation. They conclude that most patients with elevated dd-cfDNA in conjunction with preserved allograft function remained stable over follow-up without deterioration in function (as measured by eGFR) or graft loss. Strengths of this study included large sample size, a well-known research group, and a “real-world scenario” with inherent complexities that clinicians need to navigate to provide care to kidney transplant patients. There are several weaknesses that need to be highlighted, though. The study population is too heterogeneous to derive any definitive conclusions from. There are several other instances of selection bias. This is suggested by the inclusion of patients all the way from 1 mo to 4 y from transplant. The authors suggest that tests were sent for routine surveillance, but the scenarios where a clinician taking care of a patient more than a year posttransplant with preserved graft function and no DSA would send dd-cfDNA are not clear. Allograft biopsies were done for varied reasons in only a small minority of patients and on an average 2-mo postreporting of dd-cfDNA result. What immunosuppressive adjustments were performed in the interim? In the absence of these data, the interpretation that there was no impact of dd-cfDNA measurements on 1-y graft outcomes is overly simplistic. The possibility of a type II error (false-negative outcome) due to inadequate follow-up also needs to be considered. A recently published large multicenter study that included nearly 1100 kidney transplant patients demonstrated a higher risk of loss of eGFR over 3 y and de novo DSA formation over time among kidney transplant patients with dd-cfDNA >0.5%.6 In our single-center study on the calibration of dd-cfDNA with traditional histopathology and molecular tissue gene expression (MMDx, Alberta, CA), sensitized patients at high risk for rejection (preformed or de novo DSA, and/or positive flow crossmatch at transplant, and/or documented medication nonadherence) were found to have a strong correlation with dd-cfDNA >1% and subclinical AMR diagnosed by MMDx but not by histopathology.7 Similar findings were confirmed by the multicenter Trifecta study.8 This study also reported that nearly half of the AMR cases were DSA negative. Other data using tissue gene expression have shown that many DSA positive but histologic and MMDx negative AMR cases do have upregulation of rejection transcripts.9 In addition, the Banff criteria for the diagnosis of T-cell mediated rejection and AMR continue to evolve.10 Finally, it is important to realize the possibility of significant interobserver variation in transplant biopsy interpretation by pathologists. These data indicate the complexity of calibrating noninvasive biomarkers to a flawed gold standard that is a moving target. Notwithstanding the above criticisms, the study by Huang et al is important in that it provides initial data on the uncertain value of routine cross-sectional dd-cfDNA testing for patients with a low pretest probability of rejection. Two ongoing prospective studies (The Ongoing Kidney Allograft Outcomes Registry [KOAR], NCT03984747, and The Prospera Kidney Transplant ACTIVE Rejection Assessment Registry [PROACTIVE], NCT03984747) aim to assess the impact of serial dd-cfDNA surveillance in kidney transplant recipients. Until these data become available, it seems reasonable to use clinical context and personalization of care when considering the utilization of dd-cfDNA surveillance in patients with preserved allograft function at a presumed minimal risk of rejection.","2022-08-01",2022,"Transplantation","https://openalex.org/S11564597","Wolters Kluwer","0041-1337","article","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004268","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004268",NA,NA,"107","1",TRUE,"bronze","https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000004268",NA,0,FALSE

METHODS This study reports a retrospective data analysis in Banner Health Care System. Out of 109,788 adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19, the study cohort was split into patients who received Casirivimab-Imdevimab (Cas-Imd) (N=10,836; Delta-predominant period 6/2021-11/2021) and Sotrovimab (N=998; Omicron-predominant period 12/2021-1/2022) mAb compared to propensity-matched control groups (N=10,836 and N=998), respectively. Index date was the date of mAb administration or the date of positive COVID-19 testing. The primary and secondary outcomes were the incidence of composite outcome (all-cause hospitalization and/or mortality) and ICU admission at 30-days following index date, respectively. RESULTS Compared to the propensity-matched untreated control cohort, the Cas-Imd mAb reduced the composite outcome (from 7.5% to 3.7%; difference: -3.8% [95% CI: (-4.4%, -3.2%)], p &lt;0.01) regardless of their vaccination status, while Sotrovimab mAb did not (5.0% vs. 3.8%; difference: -1.2% [95% CI: (-3.1%, 0.7%)], p =0.22). In terms of the secondary outcome, similarly Cas-Imd mAb decreased ICU admission during the first hospitalization (from 1.5% to 0.5%; difference: -1.0% [95% CI: (-1.3%, -0.7%)], p &lt;0.01) compared to the control group, whereas Sotrovimab mAb did not (0.9% vs. 0.6%; difference: -0.3% [95% CI: (-1.2%, 0.6%)], p =0.61). Comparing the periods, the Omicron-predominant period was associated with lower composite outcome than that during the Delta-predominant period. CONCLUSIONS Cas-Imd mAb was effective against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, however sotrovimab lacked efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-predominant period. Key Points This retrospective propensity matched analysis showed that treatment with Cas-Imd mAb was effective against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant to reduce the all-cause hospitalization and mortality within 30 days, by contrast sotrovimab mAb utilization lacked the efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.","2022-12-26",2022,"medRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)","https://openalex.org/S4306400573","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",NA,"article","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.23.22283921","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.23.22283921","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/12/26/2022.12.23.22283921.full.pdf","cc-by-nc",NA,NA,TRUE,"green","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2022/12/26/2022.12.23.22283921.full.pdf",NA,0,FALSE
