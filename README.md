# openalexR-test
This repository contains multiple test cases and examples of using openalexR. OpenAlex is still at its development stage. The author data was just updated in Aug 2023. The recent discussion of author disambiguation can be further improved using ORCID data. 

It also has test cases for bibliometrix, for data quantitative analysis and visualization.
